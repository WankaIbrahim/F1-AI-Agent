the\nMcLaren\nTechnology\nCentre in\nWoking,\nSurrey, England. The team is a subsidiary of the McLaren Group, which owns a majority of the team. McLaren\nis best know n as a Formula One chassis constructor, the second-oldest active team and the second-most\nsuccessful Formula One team after Ferrari, having won 185 races, 12 Drivers' Championships, and eight\nConstructors' Championships. McLaren also has a history in American ope n wheel racing as both an entrant and\na chassis constructor, and has won the Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am) sports car racing\nchampionship.\nFounde d in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian\nGrand Prix, but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further\nAmerican triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue  in 1972  and\nJohnny Rutherford in 1974  and 1976 . After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, Teddy Mayer\ntook over and led the team to their first Formula One Constructors' Championship in 1974 , with Emerson\nFittipaldi and James Hunt winning the Drivers' Championship in 1974 and 1976  respectively. The year 1974\nalso marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by t he Marlboro cigarette brand.\nIn 1981, McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing; Dennis took over as team principal, and\nshortly afterwards organised a buyout  of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This\nbegan the team's most successful era; with Porsche and Honda  engines, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, and Ayrton\nSenna won seven Drivers' Championships between them and the team took six Constructors' Championships.\nThe combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant\u2014together they won all but one race in 1988 \u2014\nbut later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari. Fellow English team Williams offered the most consistent\nchallenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between 1984  and 1994 . By the mid-\n1990s , Honda  had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to Williams, and the team went three\nseasons without a win. With Mercedes-Benz engines, West sponsorship, and former Williams designer Adrian\nNewey, further championships came in 1998  and 1999  with driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen, and during the 2000s  the\nteam were consistent front-runne rs, with driver Lewis Hamilton taking their latest title in 2008 .\nMcLaren is one of only three constructors, and the only team, to complete the Triple Crown of Motorsport (wins\nat the Indianapolis 500, 24 Hours of Le Mans, and Monaco Grand Prix), a feat that McLaren achieved by\nwinning the 1995 24 H ours of Le Mans.\nRon Dennis retired as McLaren team principal in 2009, handing over to long-time McLaren employee Martin\nWhitmarsh. At the end of 2013, after the team's worst season since 2004, Whitmarsh was ousted. McLaren\nannounc ed in 2013 that they would be using Honda  engines from 2015 onwards, replacing Mercedes-Benz.[9]\nThe team raced as McLaren Honda  for the first time since 1992 at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix. In\nSeptember 2017, McLaren announc ed they had agreed on an engine supply with Renault from 2018 to 2020.\nMcLaren is using M ercedes-Benz engines from the 2021 s eason unt il at least 2030.[10][11]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3588, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97770906-daff-4e9c-80e7-0b8c4de0f6c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "97770906-daff-4e9c-80e7-0b8c4de0f6c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c29ec4cc-f481-4376-a380-2b222865c145", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "22cfa570cd89689c48437deec0ab072ae9d9c7b3783c3b0f3a0b9fb59cf0d8bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The McLaren Racing team's\nfounder Bruce McLarenAfter initially returning to the Indianapolis 500 in 2017  as a backer of Andretti Autosport to run Fernando\nAlonso and then in 2019  as an independent entry, McLaren announc ed in Augus t 2019 that they would run in\nconjunction with Arrow Schmidt Peterson Motorsports starting in 2020  to run the full IndyC ar Series, the\ncombined entry being named Arrow McLaren SP.[12] Initially having no ownership interest in the team,\nMcLaren would purchase 75% of the operation in 2021.[13] McLaren entered the electric off-road racing series\nExtreme E in 2022 ,[14] and also joined Formula E in the 2022\u201323 s eason.[15]\nBruce McLaren Motor Racing was founded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce\nMcLaren.[16] Bruce was a works driver for the British Formula One team\nCoope r with whom he had won three Grands Prix and come second in the 1960\nWorld Championship. Wanting to compete in the Australasian Tasman Series,\nBruce approached his employers, but when team owner Charles Coope r insisted\non using 1.5-litre Formula One-specification engines instead of the 2.5-litre\nmotors permitted by the Tasman rules, Bruce decided to set up his own team to\nrun him and his prospective Formula One teammate Timmy Mayer with\ncustom-built Coope r cars.[17]\nBruce won the 1964 series, but Mayer was killed in practice for the final race at\nthe Longford Circuit in Tasmania. When Bruce McLaren approached Teddy\nMayer to help him with the purchase of the Zerex sports car from Roger\nPenske, Teddy Mayer and Bruce McLaren began discussing a business\npartnership resulting in Teddy Mayer buying in to Bruce McLaren Motor\nRacing L imited (BMMR) and ul timately becoming its largest shareholder.[18][19]\nThe team, racing under the British licence,[20] was based in Feltham, England from 1963 to 1964, and in\nColnbrook, England from 1965 until 1981, and it has been based in Woking, England since 1981.[21] Despite\nthis, Bruce never used the traditional British racing green on his cars. Instead, he used colour schemes that were\nnot based on national principles (e.g. his first Formula One car, the McLaren M2B car, raced at the 1966\nMonaco Grand Prix, was painted white with a green stripe, to represent a fictional Yamura team in John\nFrankenheimer's film Grand P rix).[22]\nDuring this period, Bruce drove for his team in sports car races in the United Kingdom and North America and\nalso entered the 1965 Tasman Series with Phil Hill, but did not win it.[23] He continued to drive in Grands Prix\nfor Coope r, but judging that team's form to be waning, de cided to race his own cars in 1966.[24]\nBruce McLaren made the team's Grand Prix debut at the 1966 Monaco race (of the current Formula One teams,\nonly Ferrari is older[27][a]).[16] His race ended after nine laps due to a terminal oil leak.[29] The 1966  car was the\nM2B designed by Robin Herd, but the programme was hampered by a poor choice of engines: a 3.0-litre\nversion of Ford's Indianapolis 500 engine and a Serenissima V8 were used, the latter scoring the team's first\npoint in Britain, but both were unde rpowered and unreliable.[24][29] For 1967  Bruce decided to use a BritishHistory\nRacing history: Formula One\nEarly days (1966\u20131967)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3216, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f0613a3-4c47-4a49-ab0e-77fa2de8d4d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f0613a3-4c47-4a49-ab0e-77fa2de8d4d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b99b9f84-f4af-431f-aad0-aecff70566b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "b7f520826174a315c74353d74abdf967a3bd7ab9b83d932ef1903687ffc925cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a1ba8d2-7302-419a-b2ca-9dcc5ee067a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "46a019c3972d5970b441f01af733a183bc7ddc1137cae140696ba3bcb8086c71", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "McLaren's original\nlogo was\ndesigned by\nMichael Turner\nand featured a\nkiwi bird, a New\nZealand\nicon.[25][26]\nThe McLaren M2B, the team's first\nFormula One car\nThe McLaren M7A of 1968 gave\nMcLaren their first Formula One\nwins.

Bruce won the Race of Champions at the Brands Hatch circuit and Hulme\nwon the International Trophy  at Silverstone, both non-championship races,[34] before\nBruce took the team's first championship win at the Belgian Grand Prix.[35] Hulme also\nwon the Italian and Canadian Grands Prix later in the year, helping the\nteam to second in the Constructors' Championship.

Gurney\nwon the first two Can-Am events at Mosport and St. Jovite and placed\nninth in the third, but left the team mid-season, and Gethin took over\nfrom there. While 1971  began promisingly when Hulme led the opening\nround in South Africa before retiring with broken suspension,[38]\nultimately Hulme, Gethin (who left for BRM mid-season,[39]) and\nJackie Oliver again failed to score a win. The 1972 season saw\nimprovements though:  Hulme won the team's first Grand Prix for 21\u20442\nyears in South Africa and he and Peter Revson scored ten other podiums, the team finishing third in the\nConstructors' Championship.

The year 1975  was less\nsuccessful for the team: Fittipaldi was second in the championship\nbehind Niki Lauda. Hulme's replacement Jochen Mass took his sole GP\nwin in Spain.\nAt the end of 1975, Fittipaldi left to join his brother's\nFittipaldi/Copersucar team.[42] With the top drivers already signed to\nother teams, Mayer turned to James Hunt, a driver on whom biographer\nGerald Donaldson reflected as having \"a dubious reputation\".[44] In\n1976 , Lauda was again strong in his Ferrari; at midseason, he led the championship with 56 points while Hunt\nhad only 26 despite wins in Spain (a race from which he was initially disqualified[45]) and France.

The car with a small block\nOldsmobile had immediate success driven by Bruce McLaren. The car\nwas raced in North America and Europe in 1964 in various A sports and\nUnited States Road Racing Championship events. In 1965 the team car\nwas the M1A prototype from which the produc tion Elva M1As were\nbased. In late 1965, the M1B (also know n as Mk2) was the team car for\nthe North American races at the end of the year. For the Can-Am Series,\nwhich started in 1966, McLaren created the M3 which Bruce and Chris\nAmon drove \u2013 customer cars also appeared in several races in the 1966\nseason. With the M3, they led two races but scored no wins, and the\ninaugural title was taken by John Surtees in a Lola T70. The following\nyear, Robin Herd purpose-designed the Chevrolet V8-powered M6A, delays with the Formula One programme\nallowing the team to spend extra resources on developing the Can-Am car which was the first to be painted in\nMcLaren orange. With Denny Hulme now partnering Bruce, they won five of six races and Bruce won the\nchampionship, setting the pattern for the next four years. In the 1968 season, they used a new car, the M8, to\nwin four races; non-works McLarens took the other two, but this time Hulme was victorious overall. In the\n1969 season, McLaren domination became total as they won all 11 races with the M8B; Hulme won five, and\nBruce won six and the Drivers' Championship.[31] From 1969 onwards, McLaren M12 \u2013 the customer\n\"variant\" of the M8 \u2013 was driven by several entrants, including a version modified by Jim Hall of Chaparral\nfame. McLaren's success in Can-Am brought  with it financial rewards, both prize money and money from\nselling cars to other teams, that helped to suppor t the team and fund the nascent and relatively poor-paying\nFormula One programme.[31][198]\nWhen Bruce was killed testing the 1970 season's M8D, he was at first\nreplaced by Dan Gurney, then later by Peter Gethin. They won two and\none races, respectively, while Hulme won six on the way to the\nchampionship. Private teams competing in the 1970 Can-Am series\nincluded older M3Bs as well as the M12 \u2013 the customer version of the\nteam's M8B. In the 1971 season, the team held off the challenge of\n1969 world champion Jackie Stewart in the Lola T260, winning eight\nraces, with Peter Revson taking the title. Hulme also won three Can-Am\nraces in the 1972 season, but the McLaren M20 was defeated by the\nPorsche 917/10s of Mark Donohue  and George Follmer.

In 1981, McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing;\nDennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a buyout  of the\noriginal McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. Dennis offered\nMansour Ojjeh the chance to purchase 50% of the team in 1983, with McLaren\nbecoming a joint venture with Ojjeh's TAG Group. In 2000, after supplying\nengines to the team through its Mercedes subsidiary for 5 years,\nDaimlerChrysler (now Daimler AG) exercised an option to buy 40% of the\nTAG McLaren Group.[286] Dennis and Ojjeh each retained a 30% share,[287]\nand each sold half of their stake to the Mumtalakat Holding Company (the\nsovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom  of Bahrain) in 2007.[288] Although\nDaimler were reportedly considering acquiring the remaining 60% from Dennis\nand Ojjeh, they instead bought  Brawn GP (renaming it Mercedes GP) in\nNovember 2009;[289] their McLaren shares were sold back to Mumtalakat,\nDennis, and O jjeh in 2010.[290]\nDennis stepped down as both CEO and team principal of McLaren in 2009,\nhanding both roles over to Martin Whitmarsh.[291][292] However, following the\nuncompetitive 2013  season, Dennis retook the role in January 2014;[293]\nWhitmarsh formally left the team later that year.[294] Dennis sought  to take a\ncontrolling interest in the company, but his relationship with Ojjeh had\ndeteriorated, perhaps as early as 2013.[295][296] In 2016, Dennis was forced out\nof his role as CEO by O jjeh.[297] He sold his remaining shares in the company the next year.[298]\nAfter Dennis' 2014 return, he had abolished the position of team principal at McLaren, saying it was an\n'outdated' position.[299] \u00c9ric Boullier was instead named racing director in January 2014, becoming respons ible\nfor the F1 team.[300] After Dennis' exit, Zak Brown was chosen for the post of Group executive director, with\nthe positions of Group CEO and Racing CEO both being left vacant.[301] While his position was formally\nwithin the wider McLaren Group, it was unde rstood that his role would focus only on the F1 team. The\nincreasing awareness of the mediocrity of the car prompted a reshuffle in 2018:  Brown was appointed McLaren\nRacing CEO in April, and when Boullier resigned in July, his position was divided between Gil de Ferran as\nsporting director and Andrea Stella as performance director.[302] In May 2019, Andreas Seidl was appointed as\nthe new team principal.[303] In December 2022, Seidl left McLaren to join Sauber as CEO with Stella promoted\nto team principal.[304][305]\nSince 2004 the team has been based at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, England.[306] Facilities\nthere include a wind tunne l and a driving simulator which is said to be the most sophisticated in the sport.[307]\nThe team also created the McLaren Driver Development Programme, which currently has eight drivers signed\nto it as of July 2024.[308][309]Ownership and management\nPolitics", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3392, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "540d3edd-a6cd-40dd-a3e4-530374309cbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "540d3edd-a6cd-40dd-a3e4-530374309cbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8154405-d42c-4d03-8427-f70d3b285f6a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "f69453f36bb7636f80490e28f615f53b3d2794efc17c5b9e084914bb4501f00c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "McLaren's Formula One team was\nsponsored for 23 years by Philip\nMorris's Marlboro cigarette brand.McLaren has had an uneasy relationship with Formula One's gove rning body , the FIA, and its predecessor\nFISA, as well as with the commercial rights holders of the sport.
