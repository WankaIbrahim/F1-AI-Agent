It was first staged at Mosport Park in\nBowmanville, Ontario, as a sports car event,\nbefore alternating between Mosport and\nCircuit Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, after\nFormula One took over the event. After 1971,\nsafety concerns led to the Grand Prix moving\npermanently to Mosport. In 1978, after\nsimilar safety concerns with Mosport, the\nCanadian Grand Prix moved to its current\nhome at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Notre\nDame Island in Montreal, Quebec.\nIn 2005, the Canadian Grand Prix was the\nmost watched Formula One Grand Prix in the\nworld. The race was also the third most\nwatched sporting event worldwide, behind\nthe first place Super Bowl XXXIX and that\nyear\u2019s UEFA Champions League Final.[2]\nThe 2020  and 2021 events were cancelled\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic.[3][4] After\nthe cancellation of the 2021 Canadian Grand\nPrix, the contract was extended to 2031.[5]\nThe Canadian Grand Prix returned to the\ncalendar in the 2022  season.\nThe early Canadian Grand Prix was one of\nthe premier events of the new Canadian Sports Car Championship, a series which had been created\nalongside the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park near Toronto in 1961. M osport Park (which is still in its\noriginal layout configuration) was a spectacular and challenging circuit which had many ups and downs;\nthe circuit was popul ar with drivers. Several international sports car as well as Formula One drivers\nparticipated in the event. For the first five years, the event would be won by drivers with either prior\nFormula One experience, or would enter the championship after winning the Canadian Grand Prix.

The Ontario circuit alternated with the Circuit Mont-Tremblant in\nQuebec, where the Canadian Grand Prix was held in 1968 and 1970. Mont-Tremblant, located 11\u20442 hours\nnorthwest of Montreal, was much like Mosport Park in that it was a spectacular circuit which had\nsignificant elevation change and was very challenging. The first championship race was held between the\nGerman and Italian rounds  on 27 Augus t; it was won by Jack Brabham with his New Zealander teammate\nDenny H ulme completing a Brabham 1\u20132.\nThe 1968 event, which was moved to late September so it could be paired with the United States Grand\nPrix at Watkins Glen, saw the unlucky New Zealander Chris Amon lead from the start until 17 laps from\nthe end of the 90 lap distance when his gearbox broke; the McLaren team finished 1\u20132 with Amon's\ncountrymen Hulme and Bruce McLaren taking top honour s.\nFollowing the 1968 season, a group led by John Bassett and race sponsor Imperial Tobacco developed a\npropos al to move both the Grand Prix and Mosport's Telegram Trophy  IndyC ar race to a new street circuit\nin Toronto along Lake Shore Boulevard and through Exhibition Place with the start/finish line and pi ts to be\nlocated inside Exhibition Stadium.[6][7][8] Bassett droppe d the idea just as the bill was going through third\nreading before Toronto city counc il.[9] The idea to move the race to an urban location would return a\ndecade later.\nThe 1969 event at Mosport Park saw Briton Jackie Stewart climb up from 4th to take the lead, but Jacky\nIckx was coming up fast, and Stewart and Ickx battled until lap 33, when they came to lap privateer Al\nPease for the fourth time, Ickx attempted to pass Stewart, and the two cars collided. Stewart was unable to\nget his Matra going, but Ickx did get his Brabham going, and held onto the lead until the checkered flag. An\nangry Stewart complained to his boss Ken Tyrrell about Pease, who complained to the organizers. The 48-\nyear-old Pease was then given the black disqualification flag after completing less than half the number of\nlaps the leaders had completed in an almost embarrassingly outdated Eagle-Climax, and became the only\ndriver in F1 history ever to be disqualified for being too slow. The 1970 event saw Ickx win again with his\nSwiss teammate Clay Regazzoni making the result a Ferrari 1\u20132. But the Mont-Tremblant circuit was not\nused again for Formula One because of safety concerns regarding the bitter winters seriously affecting the\ntrack surface and a dispute with the local racing authorities there in 1972. The alternating of the race\nstoppe d and M osport solely continued to hol d the Canadian Grand Prix from 1971.\nThe 1971 event saw Mosport Park floode d with rain and fog; the main event was delayed after a fatal\naccident at a Formula Ford suppor t race and by the time it started, it was raining heavily. Jackie Stewart\ntook victory easily in a Tyrrell from Swede Ronnie Peterson in a March. 1972 saw Mosport upgraded with\nnew safety features, and Stewart won again. 1973 was an interesting event; like the race 2 years previous it\nwas a rain-soaked event.

All this meant that Briton Jackie Oliver ended\nup in the lead with American Peter Revson second and Frenchman\nJean-Pierre Beltoise third. Of these three Revson had the most\ncompetitive car and so eventually moved into the lead and led all\nthe way to the flag while Peterson's Brazilian teammate Emerson\nFittipaldi charged to try to make up for lost ground and overtook\nOliver and Beltoise in the closing laps to grab second. For hours\nafter the race confusion reigned but eventually it was confirmed that\nRevson was the winner- thanks to a lucky break when the pace car\ncame out. The 1974 event saw Fittipaldi win while his\nchampionship rivals Clay Regazzoni finished 2nd and Jody Scheckter crashed heavily after a brake failure\non his Tyrrell. There was no 1975 event, and the 1976 event was one where Briton James Hunt found out\nthat his 9 points from Brands Hatch were taken away and he was disqualified; Hunt won the Canadian\nGrand Prix event that year, driving furiously throughout  the race.\n1977 was the race where French-Canadian Gilles Villeneuve made his debut for Ferrari. But concerns\nabout the bumpy Mosport Park's safety arose when Briton Ian Ashley had a horrendous  accident while\ncresting a bumpy rise. Ashley's Hesketh flipped over the Armco guardrails and went into a television tower.\nThe German-born Englishman was seriously injured and safety operations to rescue him were inefficient\nand time-consuming; and the lack of safety at Mosport was unde rlined when Jochen Mass lost control of his\nMcLaren and hit a guardrail that virtually flattened upon impact. Jody Scheckter won this race in his Wolf,\nbut with continuing safety concerns, a new propos al was brought  forward. Labatt, the spons or who held the\nrights to F1 racing in Canada at the time, as well as the owners of Mosport Park revived the 1968 propos al\nto move the race to Toronto's Exhibition Place after the FIA deemed Mosport as an unsuitable host facility\ngoing forward.[10] Toronto city counc il turned down the proposal by a margin of two votes and within a\nfew hours, Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau had negotiated with Labatt to move the race permanently to\nMontreal.[11][12][7] A third attempt at a Toronto race eventually came to fruition by competing Canadian\nbrewer Molson in 1986 a s the Molson Indy T oronto, part of the Indy C ar World Series[13][14]\nA plan was quickly put together to develop a track called the Circuit \u00cele Notre Dame on a man-made island\nin the middle of the St. Lawrence seaway that had been the site of the famous Expo '67; specific roads on\nthe island were combined and modified, and then pit facilities were built to make a temporary race track.\nThe Canadian Grand Prix was first held there in 1978 and it has been held there ever since, with the\nexception of  four years when the event was cancelled.\nThe first winner in Montreal was Quebec native Villeneuve, driving a Ferrari. 1979 saw circuit layout\nmodifications to make it faster, and Australian Alan Jones win, and he then won the 1980 race and the\nDrivers' Championship that year. 1980 also saw a big startline pile-up with involved Jones's Brazilian\nchampionship rival Nelson Piquet after he and Jones collided going into the very fast Droit du Casino\ncorner. Piquet jumped into his spare car with a more powerful qualifying engine; but the engine blew up\nand Piquet retired from the race.

Frenchman Jacques Laffite took what was to be his last F1\nvictory, followed by B riton John W atson and V illeneuve.\nVilleneuve was killed in 1982 on his final qualifying lap for the\nBelgian Grand Prix. A few weeks after his death, the race course in\nMontreal was renamed Circuit Gilles Villeneuve after him. Gilles\nVilleneuve was one of the first people induc ted into the Canadian\nMotorsport Hall of Fame, and is so far the only Canadian winner of\nthe Formula One Canadian Grand Prix. The 1982 Canadian Grand\nPrix was a tragic event, in the shadow of the death of Villeneuve a\nmonth earlier. It saw another accident when Villeneuve's teammate\nDidier Pironi stalled at the front of the grid. First, Raul Boesel\nstruck a glancing blow to the stationary vehicle, and then Riccardo\nPaletti crashed directly into the rear of Pironi's Ferrari at over\n180 km/h (110 mph). Pironi and F1 doctor Sid Watkins came to\nPaletti's aid to try to extract him from his car, which briefly caught\nfire. After a half-hour, the 23-year-old Paletti was extracted and\nflown to a nearby hos pital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Nelson Piquet won the race in his Brabham.\n1982 was also significant in that the race was moved from October to June with the event happening in\nearly June ever since.\nIn 1983, Frenchman Ren\u00e9 Arnoux scored his first race win as a Ferrari driver, and the following year Piquet\nwon again in a BMW-powered Brabham. 1985 saw Ferrari finish 1\u20132 with Italian Michele Alboreto and\nSwede Stefan Johansson taking top honour s from Frenchman Alain Prost, while Lotus gained their final\never lock-out of the front row when Elio de Angelis and Ayrton Senna started 1\u20132. 1986 was a competitive\nrace. Finn Keke Rosberg in a McLaren charged through the field, caught and then passed British leader\nNigel Mansell. But Rosberg, like the other front runners, encountered problems, benefiting Mansell who\nwon the race. In 1987 , the race was not held due to sponsorship dispute between two local breweries,\nLabatt and Molson.[15] During the break the track was modified, and starting line moved to its current\nposition.\n1988  saw Brazilian Ayrton Senna take victory in the all-conque ring\nMcLaren MP4/4 with its Honda  turbo engine, and the following\nyear he so very nearly won again, but the Honda  engine in his\nMcLaren failed and Belgian Thierry Boutsen took victory, which\nwas the first in his F1 career. 1990, like the year before, was a rain-\nsoaked event, and it saw a number of accidents; Senna came out to\nwin again. 1991 saw a dramatic finale in which Nigel Mansell's\nWilliams failed on the very last lap only a few corners from the\nfinish line; Nelson Piquet took his 23rd and final F1 victory in a\nBenetton. Austrian Gerhard Berger won the 1992 event after the\ndominant Mansell spun off after a collision with Berger's teammate\nSenna.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3323, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f852a621-3309-47b4-94a2-9cb74ddd9d3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f852a621-3309-47b4-94a2-9cb74ddd9d3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Canadian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d9723d6-84bf-4d5d-b441-2863fbe18862", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Canadian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "d0f0ecb19213f25ddc31b4612ac211da3e035c4b77bd17201e3ebd208b0a16c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Jean Alesi at the 1995 Canadian\nGrand Prix\nLewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso\nduring the 2007 Canadian Grand PrixAlain Prost won the 1993 event while fending off a spirited drive\nfrom Senna, and in respons e to the Imola tragedies, the 1994 event\nsaw the very fast Droit du Casino curve being turned into a chicane.\nGerman Michael Schumacher won this event. Ferrari's Jean Alesi\nwon the 1995 edition, which occurred on his 31st birthday and\nwhich would be the only win of his career. Alesi had inherited the\nlead when Michael Schumacher pitted with electrical problems and\nDamon Hill's hydraulics failed. The victory was a popul ar one for\nAlesi, particularly after several unrewarded drives the year before,\nnamely in Italy. Alesi's win at Montreal was voted the most popul ar\nrace victory of the season by many, as it was the number 27 Ferrari\n\u2014onc e belonging to the famous Gilles Villeneuve at his much\nloved home Grand Prix. Schumacher gave Alesi a lift back to the pits after Alesi's car ran out of fuel just\nbefore the Pits Hairpin.\nThe Canadian Grand Prix race had grown in importance around this time; the demise of Grands Prix in\nDetroit, Phoenix and Mexico City meant that it had been the only North American Grand Prix round since\n1993 and would continue to be the only round in North America up until 2000, and again from 2008 to\n2011 after yet another demise of the United States Grand Prix, this time at Indianapolis. It was also one of\ntwo races in the entire Americas, the other being the Brazilian Grand Prix, although the Argentine Grand\nPrix had returned for 4 brief years from 1995 t o 1998.\nThe 1996 race saw the Casino corner removed and the layout changed; the run from the hairpin at the\nbottom of the circuit was turned into a straight. Briton Damon Hill won this event, and the 1997 race was\nstoppe d early due to a crash involving Olivier Panis. He was sidelined for nine races and some see it as a\nturning point in the career of the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix winner. The races from 1997 to 2004 (except\n1999 and 2001)  saw a romp of Michael Schumacher victories, all in a Ferrari. 1999 saw Finn Mika\nH\u00e4kkinen win, and in 2001 , there was the first sibling 1\u20132 finish in the history of Formula 1, as Ralf and\nMichael Schumacher toppe d the podium. The Schumacher brothers would finish 1\u20132 in the 2003 edition as\nwell, 2001 was also noted for Jean Alesi achieving Prost's best finish of the season; he celebrated his fifth\nplace by doi ng several donut s in his vehicle, and throwing hi s helmet into the crowd.\nThe 2007 race was the site of rookie Lewis Hamilton's first win. On\nlap 67, Takuma Sato overtook McLaren-Mercedes's Fernando\nAlonso, to cheers around the circuit, just after overtaking Ralf\nSchumacher and having overtaken Ferrari's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n earlier\nin the race.[16] The race saw Sato move from the middle of the grid\nto the back of the pack and to a high of fifth before a pit-stop error\ncaused him to move back to eleventh. Sato fought  up 5 places in the\nfield in the last 15 laps to finish sixth. Sato was voted \"Driver of the\nDay\" on the ITV website over Lewis Hamilton's first win.
