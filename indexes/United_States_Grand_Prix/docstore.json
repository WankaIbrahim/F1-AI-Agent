The\nGrand Prix later became part of the Formula One\nWorld Championsh ip. As of 2023 , the Grand Prix\nhas been held 52 times at ten different locations.\nSince 2012 , it has been held every year at the Circuit\nof the Americas  in Austin, Texas, except in 2020\nwhen it was cancelled due to the COVID-19\npandemic .\nInspired by the Gordon Bennett Cup and Circuit des\nArdennes  races he had competed in, William Kissam\nVanderbilt II founded a series of road races in the\nUnited States to showcase American road racing to\nthe world. The Vanderbilt Cup soon became an\ninstitution on New York's Long Island , attracting\nAmerican and European competitors alike. However ,\nthe race was plagued by crowd contr ol problems,\nwhich led to spectator deaths and injuries, and the\ncancellation of the 1907 event. Upon its return for\n1908, the American Automob ile Association  did not\nadopt the new Grand Prix regulations agreed upon by\nthe Association Internationale des Automobiles\nClubs Reconnus  (AIACR).[1][2] This led the rival\nAutomobile Club of America, an enthusiasts group\nwith strong ties to Europe, to sponsor the American\nGrand Prize, using the Grand Prix rules.[3] The\nSavannah Automob ile Club of Savannah, Geor gia,\nwhich had staged two days of successful stock car\nraces on March 18 and 19, 1908, won the rights to\nstage the event.[4]History\nBeginnings and the Vanderbilt Cup\nThe Grand Prize era", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2142, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e628d9d0-e08d-4afc-9950-34ff9e37bfba": {"__data__": {"id_": "e628d9d0-e08d-4afc-9950-34ff9e37bfba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f6c58d43-29af-43c8-979b-0c7f4a1b22a4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "f2771aec39b255c2ef90c335b0fdd74f789c3a03a0f560c345a02159096b96e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "American Grand Prize trophyThe Savannah Automobile Club laid out a lengthened version of\ntheir stock car course, totaling 25.130 mi (40.443 km). Geor gia\nGovernor M. Hoke Smith  authorized the use of convict labor  to\nconstruct the circuit of oiled gravel. The Governor also sent state\nmilitia troops to augment local police patrols in keeping the crowd\nin check, hoping to avoid the pitfall s of the Vanderbilt Cup\nraces.[4] The entry for the inaugural race featured 14 European and\nsix American entries, including factory teams from Benz , Fiat, and\nRenault .[5] In the race, held on Thanksgiving Day, Ralph DePalma\nled early in his Fiat, before falling back  with lubrication and tire\nproblems. The race came down to a three-way battle between the\nBenz of Victor H\u00e9m ery and the Fiats of Louis Wagner and Felice\nNazzaro . Wagner won the race by the close margin of 56\nseconds.[6]\nDespite the success of the Savannah event, it was decided that the\n1909 race would be held on Long Island, in conjunction with the\nVanderbilt Cup. However , only the Vanderbilt race was held and\nthe Grand Prize pushed back to the next year. After the 1910 Vanderbilt Cup saw more issues, including\nthe deaths  of two riding mechanics and several serious spectator injuries, the Grand Prize was cancelled\nonce again . A last-minute request by the Savannah club saved the race for the year, but only gave one\nmonth to prepare the course. A shorter 17.300 mi (27.842 km) course was laid out, but due to the short\nnotice, most European teams were not able to make the trip. The leading trio from 1908 did make it and\nAmerican David Bruce-Brown  joined the Benz squad. Bruce-Brown won another incredibly tight race\nover teammate H\u00e9mery , this time by only 1.42 seconds.[7] The 1911 event returned to Savannah, and this\ntime the Vanderbilt Cup came with it; the Cup and Grand Prize were to be held together until 1916.\nDespite the success of the events, public pressure started to mount on the organizers. The use of convict\nlabor and the militia drew criticism, as did the nuisance of closing roads for the event.[8] Two accidents\non the open roads in practice, one resulting in the death of Jay McNay , cast a shadow over the event. The\nAmerican entries dominated the support events and ran well throughout the Grand Prize, after poor\nshowings in past years and once again Bruce-Brown triumphed, this time driving a Fiat.[9]\nFor 1912, Savannah  succumbed to public pressure, and Milwaukee , Wisconsin , won the bid for the race.\nA narrow, 7.880 mi (12.682 km) trapezoidal course was set up on the outskirts of the city, in Wauwatosa .\nAs in 1911, tragedy struck in practice when David Bruce-Brown was killed after a puncture sent him off\nthe road. On the final lap of the race, Ralph DePalma  collided with eventual winner Caleb Bragg ,\nseriously injuring DePalma and his mechanic and ending any chance of a second race at Milwaukee.[10]\nThe Grand  Prize was not held in 1913, after Long Island's bid was rejected and Savannah refused to\nprovide sufficient prize money . Oval racin g on board tracks  had taken off in the United States, to the\ndetriment of road racing. For 1914, the Grand Prize and Vanderbilt Cup were staged in Santa Monica\nRoad Race Course , near Los Angeles , on an 8.417 mi (13.546 km) course, with the start/finish straight\nalong the Pacific Ocean. The field was primarily American entries (twelve, against five European entries),\nand the Americans dominated, with Eddie Pullen's Mercer  winning by over 40 seconds.[11] In 1915, the\nrace shifted to San Francisco, in conjunction with the Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition . With the\noutbreak of World War I in Europe, almost all of the drivers and cars were American, except for a few\ncars imported earlier .

The\nrace would be a part of the AAA  National Championship , which\ncarried a 4.91-liter displacement limit. Although the limit for the\nGrand Prize was 7.37 liters, no large-displacement cars would\nenter . The race was the penultimate round of the championship,\nwith Dario Resta leading Johnny Aitken  after his Vanderbilt Cup\nwin. However , both cars would be out before halfway . Although\nAitken took over teammate Howdy Wilcox 's car for the win, the\nAAA  awarded points only to Wilcox, and Resta took the championship.[13][14]\nThe Grand Prize was discontinued after the 1916 event. Between a lack of European participation due to\nWorld War I and the growing American interest in oval racing, road racing fell by the wayside. The two\nSanta Monica events were the only road races on the 1916 championship, and the aborted 1917 National\nChampionship was slated to feature eight events, all ovals and six of them board tracks.[15] The\nVanderbilt Cup was reviv ed in 1936 and 1937 and run to Grand Prix regulations; these races were run at\nthe Roosevelt Park Autodrome near New York City but a lack of competition and domination by German\nBernd Rosemeyer and Italian Tazio Nuvolari led to the races being a commercial failure.\nThe Indianapolis 500 kept a connection to European racing, running to Grand Prix regulations between\n1923 and 1930,[1] and from 1938 until 1953.[16] In the late 1920s, efforts were made to refer to the 500 as\nthe American Grand Prize.[17] The Grand Prize trophy was awarded to the winner of the Indianapolis 500\nbetween 1930[18] and 1936, when it was replaced by the Borg-Warner Trophy .

The track was formed using service\nroads and runways of Sebring's airport, and it became a round of the World Sportscar Championship  in\n1953. Buoyed by the success of the 12 Hours, the Riverside sports car race and Formula Libre  even ts at\nWatkins Glen  and Lime Rock Park, Ulmann decided to stage a Formula One race at Sebring International\nRaceway  in 1959.

The race was originally scheduled for March 22, the day after\nthe 12 Hour-race, but rescheduled for December 12, the final round of the season.[23] The race took place\n3 months after the previous round at Monza . The starting grid included seven American drivers, but New\nZealand's Bruce McLaren , in a Cooper , took his first win in F1 and was, at the time, the youngest driver\never to win a Grand  Prix. McLaren took the lead on the last lap of the race when his team-mate, Jack\nBrabham , ran out of fuel. Brabham had to push his car over the line to finish fourth. By virtue of Ferrari 's\nTony Broo ks finishing third, Brabham and Cooper took the Drivers' and Constructors' championships,\nrespectively .[24] Despite providing an exciting climax to the season, the race was not successful from the\nhosts' standpoint, the race's isolated location did not help the event's success as the promoters barely\nbroke even. When prize money checks bounced, Charles Moran  and Briggs Cunningham  paid the money\nto save face for their country .[16]\nUlmann moved the race across the country to Riverside for 1960 . Stirling Moss  put on quite a show in his\nprivately entered Lotus  by winnin g from pole position. However , while the driver's purse was enormo us\n(as at Sebring), the event was no better received than the previous year's due to a lack of promotion, and\nproximity to the successful Times Grand Prix.[19] Agai n Moran and Cunningham would  pay the prize\nmoney .[16]\nThrough most of 1961, Ulmann was listed as the promoter of the USGP; he contacted organizers in\nMiami  and Bill France  of the Daytona International Speedway  but was unable to reach agreements. In\nAugust, racing promoter Cameron Argetsinge r, executive director of the 2.350 mi (3.782 km) Watkins\nGlen Grand Prix Race Course  in the central Finger Lakes region  of upstate New York, offered his circuit\nto the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States  (ACCUS ) to host the Grand Prix. The\nWatkins Glen circuit, which had hosted Formula Libre  events, had simila rities to the British  Brands\nHatch  circuit: both had several banked corners and were sited in very green parts of the world.[25]\nACCUS accepted on August 28. Watkins Glen would host the United States Grand Prix for the next 20\nyears, longer than any other location before or since. It would receive the Grand Prix Drivers' Association\naward for the best-or ganized and best-staged Grand Prix of the season in 1965 , 1970 , and 1971 . The track\nwould become known as the \"Mecca\" of American road racing and weave itself into European Grand Prix\nracing culture.[26]\nWith just six weeks to organize the October 8 event, Argetsinger assembled the field, but was unable to\nconvince Scuderia Ferrari  to make the trip, leaving Richie Ginther  and recently crowned World\nChampion Phil Hill out of their home Grand Prix.[16] Innes Ireland took a surprise win, his first and the\nfirst for Team Lotus . Dan Gurney 's Porsche  was secon d, and Tony Brooks , racing in his last Grand Prix,\ntook third. Stirling Moss, in his own final Grand Prix, retired with engine problems. Unlike the previous\ntwo races,  the race was well attended (over 60,000) and turned a profit. The race purse was paid in cash, a\npopular move with the teams after the previous two years' payment issues.[16]\n1962 saw Briton Jim Clark win in a Lotus; the next three races were won by fellow-Briton Graham Hill,\neach time in a BRM. Hill's 1964 win enabled him to carry a points advantage into the next and final race\nin Mexico. 1966 and 1967 saw Clark win; the '66 win was the only Formula One race he won that year,\ndriving a Lotus with an overweight BRM  H16 engine.

In part to offset this, race organizers offered\nlarge sums of prize money; in 1969 the purse totaled $200,000 (with $50,000 for the winner),[27] and\nwhen in 1972 it was raised to $275,000, the Tyrrell  team earned a record $100,000.[28]\n1970 saw Brazilian  newcomer Emerson Fittipaldi  won the race in just his fourth Formula One start.\nStewart retired his new Tyrrell and Fittipaldi, driving a Lotus, held off a charge from Mexican Pedro\nRodriguez in a BRM . It was an emotional win for Colin Chapman's Lotus team,  as team leader Rindt had\nbeen killed while practicing for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Lotus had not run the Canadian Grand\nPrix, but because the next closest championship contender Jacky Ickx did not score enough points to keep\nhim in contention, the Drivers' Championship was won by Rindt posthumously at this race. Team Lotus\nalso won the Constructors' Championship at the 1970 event.\nIn 1971, the course was changed considerably . The entire lower\nsection of the track was reconfigure d, and a new section was\nconstructed which added more than a mile to the course, lengthening\nit to 3.377  mi (5.435 km). It also saw a new pitlane and pit straight\nand three new corne rs (a new first, second-to last and last corners).\nThe improvements cost nearly $2.5 million ($13 million in 2010\ndollars).[29] The alterations considerably height ened the driving\nchallenge of the track, and it became even more popular than it had\nbeen with drivers, teams and fans. Watkins Glen had been\ntransformed from a quick, small circuit into a fast and very tough up-\nand-down circuit where just about every  corner was banked and long;\nuncommonly hard driving and maximum effort was required for\nalmost every part of a lap. 1971 was the first running on the completed full circuit (the circuit was not\ncompleted in time for previous races, so the completed short circuit was used) and it saw popular\nFrenchman Fran\u00e7ois Cevert  win his only Grand Prix for Tyrrell, and the biggest cash prize in Formula\nOne: $267 ,000. 1972  saw Jackie Stewart win after Emerson Fittipaldi had alrea dy won the championship\nat the previous race,  the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

The 1978 race took place two weeks after the death of Ronnie Peterson at Monza. Andretti had\nalready accumulated enough points to win the Drivers' Championship before coming to Watkins Glen.\nMechanical problems forced Andretti to retire early from the race, which was won by Carlos Reutemann\nin a Ferrari 312T3 . 1979 saw Ferrari driver Gilles Villeneuve win a wet race after Australian Alan  Jones\nretired after dominating much of the race.\nBy this time, Watkin s Glen had begun to deteriorate.

Phoenix, like\nmany American cities, was designed on the grid system; the circuit was made up entirely of second-gear\n90-degree corners and provided nearly no driving challenge or exciting corners to watch cars go around.\nThe circuit was less bumpy and wider than Detroit, and its long straights made it easy to overtake and\ndifficult to judge braking.\nThe inaug ural event  in 1989 was held at short notice and it could only be held in June (Detroit's former\ndate), one of the hottest months in Phoe nix, a city with summer temperatures regularly going past 110 \u00b0F\n(43 \u00b0C). Temperatures neared 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) on race weekend. Out of 40,000 capacity , 34,441 tickets\nwere sold. Ecclestone expected the event to be sold out but was told that the local populace avoided\noutdoor events during summer .[41] The race was moved to March, as the opening round of the season, for\nthe next two years.

The 1989 race saw Prost win his only Grand Prix in the United States by\ntaking advantage of Senna's engine electronics problems. The 1990 race saw emerging French star Jean\nAlesi  harrying Senna for a number of laps; the Tyrrell driver went on to finish secon d behind Senna. The\ncircuit had to be changed for the 1991  race due to the construction of a new Phoenix Suns basketball\narena, and the revised circuit was generally seen to be an improvement. Senna  won the race from pole\nposition. On October 7, 1991, members of International Auto Sport Federation (FISA) met to discuss the\nagenda for the 1992 Formula One season, where they voted to cancel the contract with city of Phoenix.\nThat same year, Phoenix assistant city manager David Garcia said the city had already invested\n$1.3 million dollars preparing for the 1992 race and was in negotiations with Ecclestone on contract\ncancellation.[42] Ecclestone was asked if poor attendance was to blame for the Phoenix race pull out; he\nsaid that attendance was never a problem  but the inability to place more than 20,000 seats in a way wherePhoenix (1989\u20131991)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3524, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7476b7c6-5717-4310-ae49-2fce5691f736": {"__data__": {"id_": "7476b7c6-5717-4310-ae49-2fce5691f736", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8204a75e-b965-491e-8ff4-17cf511c7ded", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "b05f3db9ed4979643f93062d2d80d4d77c8d6994f9738614bbfd4376f479f5b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Crowds at the inaugural running of\nthe United States Grand Prix at\nIndianapolis exceeded 200,000\nThe 2003 USGP at Indianapolisfans could have a better view was.[43] There were rumors  of a race on the streets of the Manhattan\nborough of New York City for 1992 and a race on the streets of the Las Vegas Strip  for 1995, but these\nnever materialized and a Formula 1 event would not be held in United States for the next 9 years.\nIt was not until 2000  that another United  States Grand Prix took\nplace, this time at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway  in Indiana.\nIndianapolis was rumored to have been considering a Formula\nOne race since the USGP  left Phoenix; with a proposed street race\nfor the 1990 season  in downtown Indianapolis.[44] The 2.606 mi\n(4.194 km) infield road course uses about a mile of the oval, but in\na clockwise direction.

Held in September in its first four years (in\norder to distance it from the \"500\" and NASCAR 's Brickyard 400), the USGP  at Indianapolis was moved\nto an early summer date in 2004  in late June, 3 weeks after the Indy 500 so it could be paired with the\nCanadian Grand Prix and to make room for new Asian rounds. In 2005 , problems  with Michelin  tires led\nto seven teams withdrawing from the race after the formation lap. Only the three teams (six cars) with\nBridgestone  tires started the race, and the even t was considered a farce with Ferrari's Michael\nSchumacher claiming a third consecutive win in the United States Grand Prix ahead of teammate\nBarrichello with Portuguese driver  Tiago Monteiro  claiming his only Formula One podium finish by\nfinishing a lap down on winner Schumacher in third place for the Jordan team.[46] Many commentators\nquestioned whether a United States Grand Prix would be held in Indianapolis again, but the 2006 United\nStates Grand Prix was held the next year, on July 2, 2006, without controversy with Schumacher winning\nthe event for a fourth consecutive time and fifth time overall, ahead of his then-new Ferrari teammate\nFelipe Massa .

In March 2010,\nEcclestone announced plans to bring a Formula One race to New York City for the 2012  season.\nEcclestone was quoted as saying the race would take place across the Hudson River in New Jerse y, with\nthe Manhattan  skyline overlooking  the circuit.[52] In May 2010, plans  emer ged for a circuit to be built in\nJersey City's Liberty State Park,[53][54] but those  plans were abandoned shortly thereafter .[55] A race in\nWest New York and Weehawken  was later announced in October 2011. In May 2010, it was announced\nthat Monticello Motor Club  in upstate New York\u2014a circuit complex modeled on a private country club\nnear Monticello \u2014had submitted a bid for the rights to host the race.[56]\nOn May 25, 2010, Austin, Texas, was awarded the race on a ten-\nyear contract, as Ecclestone and event promoter Full Throttle\nProductions agreed to a deal beginning in 2012 . The event is being\nheld on a purpose-built new track, which was named Circuit of the\nAmericas  (COT A).[57] German architect  and track designer\nHermann Tilke designed the new track on 800 acres (320 ha) of\nland to the east of the city.[58] In July 2010, promoter Tavo\nHellmund  promised  that the circuit would be one of the \"most\nchallenging and spectacular in the world\" and that it would include\na selection of corner sequences inspired by \"the very best circuits\"\nin the world.[59]\nOn November 15, 2011, it was reported that construction of the circuit had been temporarily halted as the\nowners had not yet been awarded the contract to stage the race in 2012,[60] following reports that Bernie\nEcclestone  had cast doubt on the race taking place.[61][62][63] After Tavo Hellmund's contract was found\nin breach by Ecclest one[64] and a new contract was entered into between Formula 1 and the original track\ninvestors, Red McCombs and Bobby Epstein, the US Grand Prix was confirmed to be held at the Circuit\nof the Americas in Austin on the origin al scheduled date in 2012.[65][66] Reigning champion Sebastian\nVettel took pole for the first race at the Texas circuit but it was 2007 winner Lewis Ham ilton who kept his\nunbeaten run in the US as the two finished almost 40 seconds ahead of third.\nOn November 11, 2015, the Texas government cut nearly $6 million of the required $25 million in\nfunding to host the event.[67] Attendance numbers had dropped to 224,01 1 in October 2015, for the 2015\nUnited States Grand Prix event, after heavy rain from a quickly dissipating Hurricane Patricia .[68] On\nMarch 9, 2016, it was confirmed the race would continue to run in Austin, despite the funding cuts. 2016\nturned out to be the best-attended Grand Prix in Austin: boosted by a heated World Drivers'\nChampionship battle between Lewis Hamilton  and Nico Rosber g, good weather , and the allure of a\nSaturday night concert from pop singer Taylor Swift , nearly 270,000 people went through the turnstilesAustin (2012\u20132019, 2021\u2013)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bf9985b-22ab-40ee-a6c0-164a1e196865": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bf9985b-22ab-40ee-a6c0-164a1e196865", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65933b1d-5569-470b-a32d-75eae97c5df9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "581028ba0892f81a985fe1dce55e0e1a5f63def6a747e7f304059abbc7216927", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Drivers' Parade at the 2021 USGPduring the race weekend.[69] On October 22, 2017, Lewis\nHamilton won the race.

The United States was thus the\nfirst nation since Italy in 1957  to hold two Formula One Grands Prix in the same season. During the years\n1976 \u20131980  when both Grands Prix ran, the United States Grand Prix was also referred to as the United\nStates Grand Prix East. The Caesars Palace Grand Prix ran as a Formula One World Championship race\nin Las Vegas in 1981  and 1982  (after which it continued two further years as an event in the CAR T\nseries). 1982  saw the inaugural Detroit Grand Prix in the center of Detroit , Michigan , which ran until\n1988 .
