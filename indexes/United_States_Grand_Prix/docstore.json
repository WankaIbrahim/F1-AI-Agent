Georgia\nGovernor M. Hoke Smith authorized the use of convict labor to\nconstruct the circuit of oiled gravel. The Governor also sent state\nmilitia troops  to augment local police patrols in keeping the crowd\nin check, hoping to avoid the pitfalls of the Vanderbilt Cup races.[4]\nThe entry for the inaugural race featured 14 European and six\nAmerican entries, including factory teams from Benz, Fiat, and\nRenault.[5] In the race, held on Thanksgiving Day, Ralph DePalma\nled early in his Fiat, before falling back with lubrication and tire\nproblems.

However, only the\nVanderbilt race was held and the Grand Prize pushed back to the next year.

A shorter 17.300 mi (27.842 km) course was laid out,\nbut due to the short notice, most European teams were not able to make the trip. The leading trio from 1908\ndid make it and American David Bruce-Brown joined the Benz squad. Bruce-Brown won another\nincredibly tight race over teammate H\u00e9mery, this time by only 1.42 seconds .[7] The 1911 event returned to\nSavannah, and this time the Vanderbilt Cup came with it; the Cup and Grand Prize were to be held together\nuntil 1916 . Despite the success of the events, public pressure started to mount on the organizers. The use of\nconvict labor and the militia drew criticism, as did the nuisance of closing roads for the event.[8] Two\naccidents on the open roads in practice, one resulting in the death of Jay McNay, cast a shadow over the\nevent. The American entries dominated the suppor t events and ran well through out the Grand Prize, after\npoor showings in past years and onc e again Bruce-Brown triumphed, this time driving a Fiat.[9]\nFor 1912, Savannah succumbed to public pressure, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, won the bid for the race. A\nnarrow, 7.880 mi (12.682 km) trapezoidal course was set up on the outskirts of the city, in Wauwatosa. As\nin 1911, tragedy struck in practice when David Bruce-Brown was killed after a punc ture sent him off the\nroad. On the final lap of the race, Ralph DePalma collided with eventual winner Caleb Bragg, seriously\ninjuring D ePalma and hi s mechanic and ending any chance of a second r ace at Milwaukee.[10]\nThe Grand Prize was not held in 1913 , after Long Island's bid was rejected and Savannah refused to\nprovide sufficient prize money. Oval racing on board tracks had taken off in the United States, to the\ndetriment of road racing. For 1914, the Grand Prize and Vanderbilt Cup were staged in Santa Monica Road\nRace Course, near Los Angeles, on an 8.417 mi (13.546 km) course, with the start/finish straight along the\nPacific Ocean.

With\nthe outbreak of World War I in Europe, almost all of the drivers and\ncars were American, except for a few cars imported earlier. The\n3.840 mi (6.180 km) course was set up around the Exposition\ngrounds  and nearby oval track with a boarded main straightaway.\nHeavy rain began two hours into the race, covering the circuit in\nmud from the extensive flower arrangements, and warping the main\nstraight's boards. Dario Resta in a Peugeot cruised to a seven-\nminute victory, and followed up a week later by winning the\nVanderbilt Cup.[12] For 1916, the Grand Prize returned to Santa\nMonica. The race would be a part of the AAA National\nChampionship, which carried a 4.91- liter displacement limit. Although the limit for the Grand Prize was\n7.37 liters, no large-displacement cars would enter. The race was the penultimate round of the\nchampionship, with Dario Resta leading Johnny Aitken after his Vanderbilt Cup win. However, both cars\nwould be out before halfway. Although Aitken took over teammate Howdy Wilcox's car for the win, the\nAAA awarded poi nts only to Wilcox, a nd R esta took t he championship.[13][14]\nThe Grand Prize was discontinued after the 1916 event. Between a lack of European participation due to\nWorld War I and the growing American interest in oval racing, road racing fell by the wayside. The two\nSanta Monica events were the only road races on the 1916 championship, and the aborted 1917 National\nChampionship was slated to feature eight events, all ovals and six of them board tracks.[15] The Vanderbilt\nCup was revived in 1936 and 1937 and run to Grand Prix regulations; these races were run at the Roosevelt\nPark Autodrome near New York City but a lack of competition and domination by German Bernd\nRosemeyer and Italian Tazio Nuvolari led to the races being a commercial failure.\nThe Indianapolis 500 kept a conne ction to European racing, running to Grand Prix regulations between\n1923 and 1930,[1] and from 1938 until 1953.[16] In the late 1920s , efforts were made to refer to the 500 as\nthe American Grand Prize.[17] The Grand Prize trophy was awarded to the winner of the Indianapolis 500\nbetween 1930[18] and 1936, when it was replaced by the Borg-Warner Trophy . The race was included in\nthe World Championship from 1950 t hrough 1960.\nIn 1957, Riverside International Raceway opened in Riverside, California, about 50-mile (80 km) east of\nLos Angeles. One of its first events was an SCCA National sports car race. For 1958, the race moved to the\nnew, professional USAC Road Racing Championship, and was billed as the \"United States Grand\nPrix\".[16][19] The race attracted over 50 cars and drivers from sports car series in the US and Europe, as\nwell as USAC and NASCAR. Chuck Daigh won in a Scarab, beating Dan Gurney's Ferrari in second\nplace.[20][21]\nRussian-born Alec Ulmann staged the first 12 Hours of Sebring endurance race in 1952 at the airport\n(conve rted from World War II use) of the rather isolated central Florida town of Sebring, located 1-1/2\nhours south of Orlando and Tampa, and 3 hours north of Miami.

The race was billed as the \"II United States Grand Prix\",[22] cementing the Riverside race as a part\nof the Grand Prix's heritage. The race was originally scheduled for March 22, the day after the 12 Hour-\nrace, but rescheduled for December 12, the final round of the season.[23] The race took place 3 months after\nthe previous round at Monza. The starting grid included seven American drivers, but New Zealand's Bruce\nMcLaren, in a Coope r, took his first win in F1 and was, at the time, the younge st driver ever to win a Grand\nPrix. McLaren took the lead on the last lap of the race when his team-mate, Jack Brabham, ran out of fuel.\nBrabham had to push his car over the line to finish fourth. By virtue of Ferrari's Tony Brooks  finishing\nthird, Brabham and Coope r took the Drivers' and Constructors' championships, respectively.[24] Despite\nproviding an exciting climax to the season, the race was not successful from the hosts' standpoi nt, the race's\nisolated location did not help the event's success as the promoters barely broke even. When prize money\nchecks bounc ed, Charles Moran and Briggs Cunningha m paid the money to save face for their country.[16]\nUlmann moved the race across the country to Riverside for 1960 . Stirling Moss put on quite a show in his\nprivately entered Lotus by winning from pole position. However, while the driver's purse was enormous (as\nat Sebring), the event was no better received than the previous year's due to a lack of promotion, and\nproximity to the successful Times Grand Prix.[19] Again Moran and Cunningha m would pay the prize\nmoney.[16]\nThrough most of 1961, Ulmann was listed as the promoter of the USGP; he contacted organizers in Miami\nand Bill France of the Daytona International Speedway but was unable to reach agreements. In Augus t,\nracing promoter Cameron Argetsinger, executive director of the 2.350 mi (3.782 km) Watkins Glen Grand\nPrix Race Course in the central Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, offered his circuit to the\nAutomobile Competition Committee for the United States (ACCUS) to host the Grand Prix. The Watkins\nGlen circuit, which had hosted Formula Libre events, had similarities to the British Brands Hatch circuit:\nboth had several banked corners and were sited in very green parts of the world.[25] ACCUS accepted on\nAugus t 28. Watkins Glen would host the United States Grand Prix for the next 20 years, longe r than any\nother location before or since. It would receive the Grand Prix Drivers' Association award for the best-\norganized and best-staged Grand Prix of the season in 1965 , 1970 , and 1971 . The track would become\nknow n as the \"Mecca\" of American road racing and weave itself into European Grand Prix racing\nculture.[26]\nWith just six weeks to organize the October 8 event, Argetsinger assembled the field, but was unable to\nconvince Scuderia Ferrari to make the trip, leaving Richie Ginther and recently crowned World Champion\nPhil Hill out of their home Grand Prix.[16] Innes Ireland took a surprise win, his first and the first for Team\nLotus. Dan Gurney's Porsche was second, and Tony Brooks, racing in his last Grand Prix, took third.\nStirling Moss, in his own final Grand Prix, retired with engine problems. Unlike the previous two races, the\nrace was well attended (over 60,000)  and turned a profit. The race purse was paid in cash, a popul ar move\nwith the teams after the previous two years' payment issues.[16]Watkins Glen (1961\u20131980)\n1960s", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3774, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "433e8399-7324-454b-be9c-cb32a3a4c086": {"__data__": {"id_": "433e8399-7324-454b-be9c-cb32a3a4c086", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a19eef47-0271-498d-82e0-678c5c2984b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "6abd6203f0d8faa779fbc41d9980510d77acad4c4a13fe55724985d9c04cdf0f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Denny Hulme finished 5th in a\nMcLaren M7A in the 1968 event\nTicket stub from the 1973 USGP1962 saw Briton Jim Clark win in a Lotus; the next three races\nwere won by fellow-Briton Graham Hill, each time in a BRM.\nHill's 1964  win enabled him to carry a points advantage into the\nnext and final race in Mexico. 1966 and 1967 saw Clark win; the\n'66 win was the only Formula One race he won that year, driving a\nLotus with an overweight BRM H16 engine. Both the Drivers' and\nConstructors' championships were clinched at the event by\nAustralian Jack Brabham and his Brabham team. In 1967, Clark\ndominated, leading comfortably from his teammate Hill and Denny\nHulme in a Brabham. In 1968, Mario Andretti put his Lotus 49 on\npole position in his first Formula One race. But Andretti retired, and\nBriton Jackie Stewart won the race in a Ford/Cosworth-powered Matra. Austrian Jochen Rindt won in\n1969\u2014hi s first Formula One race win.

In part to offset this, race organizers offered\nlarge sums of prize money; in 1969 the purse totaled $200,000 (with $50,000 for the winner),[27] and when\nin 1972 i t was raised to $275,000, t he Tyrrell team earned a record $100,000.[28]\n1970 saw Brazilian newcomer Emerson Fittipaldi won the race in just his fourth Formula One start. Stewart\nretired his new Tyrrell and Fittipaldi, driving a Lotus, held off a charge from Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a\nBRM. It was an emotional win for Colin Chapman's Lotus team, as team leader Rindt had been killed while\npracticing for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Lotus had not run the Canadian Grand Prix, but because the\nnext closest championship contender Jacky Ickx did not score enough points to keep him in contention, the\nDrivers' Championship was won by Rindt posthumously at this race. Team Lotus also won the\nConstructors' Championship at the 1970 e vent.\nIn 1971, the course was changed considerably. The entire lower\nsection of the track was reconfigured, and a new section was\nconstructed which added more than a mile to the course, lengthening it\nto 3.377 mi (5.435 km). It also saw a new pitlane and pit straight and\nthree new corners (a new first, second-to last and last corners). The\nimprovements cost nearly $2.5 million ($13 million in 2010\ndollars).[29] The alterations considerably heightened the driving\nchallenge of the track, and it became even more popul ar than it had\nbeen with drivers, teams and fans. Watkins Glen had been transformed\nfrom a quick, small circuit into a fast and very tough up-and-down\ncircuit where just about every corner was banked and long;\nuncommonly hard driving and maximum effort was required for almost\nevery part of a lap. 1971 was the first running on the completed full circuit (the circuit was not completed in\ntime for previous races, so the completed short circuit was used) and it saw popul ar Frenchman Fran\u00e7ois\nCevert win his only Grand Prix for Tyrrell, and the biggest cash prize in Formula One: $267,000. 1972 saw1970s", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3449, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b43f759-5c15-463e-8824-c133ff454896": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b43f759-5c15-463e-8824-c133ff454896", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c257a058-ef3f-44cf-bb4f-1181773f3a49", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "3bf5122968d45dbe5c5be509251476b85ee726cc3110dec9359baf6b054d00d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50fa404c-25aa-4b19-911b-fcd98879b7fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ef8436c47a3675b6472a29e40fbe92ce53b489693860ed7026d61a1708b26cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Jackie Stewart win after Emerson Fittipaldi had already won the championship at the previous race, the\nItalian Grand Prix at Monza.

A distraught Stewart and his team's\nmanager Ken Tyrrell withdrew the team, handing the Constructors' Championship to Lotus. Stewart retired\nwith immediate effect. In the race, Swede Ronnie Peterson in a Lotus beat Briton driver James Hunt in a\nHesketh-entered March to the finish by 0.6 of a second.

Regazzoni, driving a Ferrari, ran into a host of problems during the race and\nfinished out of the points. Fittipaldi finished fifth, which won him his second Drivers' Championship.

The race was a politically charged event. Regazzoni held up Fittipaldi's\nsecond-placed McLaren for six laps to try to help his teammate and leader of the race Niki Lauda get ahead;\nFittipaldi eventually lapped the Swiss. However, Regazzoni was black-flagged by Clerk of the Course\nBerdie Martin, angering Ferrari team manager Luca di Montezemolo, who withdrew Regazzoni in protest.\nTheir other driver, recently crowned Drivers' Champion L auda, went on to win from Fittipaldi.\n1976 saw James Hunt win in a McLaren while his closest championship contender Lauda finished third,\nputting Hunt just three points behind Lauda for the season's final race at Fuji, Japan.

The Detroit Grand Prix was\nthe longe st lasting, from 1982 to 1988;  plans to continue Formula\nOne races in Detroit at Belle Isle Park did not materialize, and in\n1989, Formula One moved to the Sonoran Desert city of Phoenix,\nArizona, bringing the United States Grand Prix name back for the\nfirst time since 1980 .[40] The Phoenix street circuit in the center of\nthe city was unpopul ar with drivers and the event was largely ignored by the local popul ace. Phoenix, like\nmany American cities, was designed on the grid system; the circuit was made up entirely of second-gear 90-\ndegree corners and provided nearly no driving challenge or exciting corners to watch cars go around. The\ncircuit was less bumpy and wider than Detroit, and its long straights made it easy to overtake and difficult to\njudge  braking.\nThe inaugural event in 1989 was held at short notice and it could only be held in June (Detroit's former\ndate), one of the hottest months in Phoenix, a city with summer temperatures regularly going past 110 \u00b0F\n(43 \u00b0C). Temperatures neared 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) on race weekend. Out of 40,000 capacity, 34,441 tickets were\nsold. Ecclestone expected the event to be sold out but was told that the local popul ace avoided outdoor\nevents during summer.[41] The race was moved to March, as the opening round of the season, for the next\ntwo years. The McLaren team dominated all three years, with Alain Prost winning in 1989 and Ayrton\nSenna in 1990 and 1991. The 1989 race saw Prost win his only Grand Prix in the United States by taking\nadvantage of Senna's engine electronics problems. The 1990 race saw emerging French star Jean Alesi\nharrying Senna for a number of laps; the Tyrrell driver went on to finish second behind Senna. The circuit\nhad to be changed for the 1991 race due to the construction of a new Phoenix Suns basketball arena, and\nthe revised circuit was generally seen to be an improvement. Senna won the race from pole position. On\nOctober 7, 1991, members of International Auto Sport Federation (FISA) met to discuss the agenda for the\n1992 Formula One season, where they voted to cancel the contract with city of Phoenix. That same year,\nPhoenix assistant city manager David Garcia said the city had already invested $1.3 million dollars\npreparing for the 1992 race and was in negotiations with Ecclestone on contract cancellation.[42] Ecclestone\nwas asked if poor attendance was to blame for the Phoenix race pull out; he said that attendance was never\na problem but the inability to place more than 20,000 seats in a way where fans could have a better viewPhoenix (1989\u20131991)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3830, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81c98fa6-89a7-4a78-84b4-770e7c7ed593": {"__data__": {"id_": "81c98fa6-89a7-4a78-84b4-770e7c7ed593", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75b7acb0-af51-4578-9cd4-9f29f492a678", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "4d42f438c20f7e271f93a66f0ce20c18f962ea6ce5a85f36d70104ac56008de3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Crowds at the inaugural running of\nthe United States Grand Prix at\nIndianapolis exceeded 200,000\nThe 2003 USGP at Indianapoliswas.[43] There were rumors of a race on the streets of the Manhattan borough of New York City for 1992\nand a race on the streets of the Las Vegas Strip for 1995, but  these never materialized and a Formula 1 event\nwould not  be held in United States for the next 9 ye ars.\nIt was not until 2000  that another United States Grand Prix took\nplace, this time at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indiana.\nIndianapolis was rumored to have been considering a Formula One\nrace since the USGP left Phoenix; with a proposed street race for\nthe 1990 season in downtown Indianapolis.[44] The 2.606 mi\n(4.194 km) infield road course uses about a mile of the oval, but in\na clockwise direction.

In\n2001, the race took place less than three weeks after the September\n11, 2001 attacks in the US, and many teams and drivers featured\nspecial tributes to the USA on their cars and helmets and saw McLaren driver H\u00e4kkinen take his last Grand\nPrix win. The 2002 edition saw Schumacher and teammate Rubens Barrichello trading places near the\nfinish line as Schumacher attempted to engineer a dead heat with Barrichello. 2003  saw a race held in\nmixed conditions race won by Michael Schumacher. Held in September in its first four years (in order to\ndistance it from the \"500\"  and NASCAR's Brickyard 400), the USGP at Indianapolis was moved to an\nearly summer date in 2004  in late June, 3 weeks after the Indy 500 so it could be paired with the Canadian\nGrand Prix and to make room for new Asian rounds . In 2005 , problems with Michelin tires led to seven\nteams withdrawing from the race after the formation lap. Only the three teams (six cars) with Bridgestone\ntires started the race, and the event was considered a farce with Ferrari's Michael Schumacher claiming a\nthird consecutive win in the United States Grand Prix ahead of teammate Barrichello with Portugue se driver\nTiago Monteiro claiming his only Formula One podium finish by finishing a lap down on winner\nSchumacher in third place for the Jordan team.[46] Many commentators questioned whether a United States\nGrand Prix would be held in Indianapolis again, but the 2006 United States Grand Prix was held the next\nyear, on July 2, 2006, without controversy with Schumacher winning the event for a fourth consecutive\ntime and fifth time overall, ahead of his then-new Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa.

Due to the expensive fees paid to host a Grand Prix, the race would require a title sponsor\nto be econom ically viable.[49] Ultimately, the United States Grand Prix was not on the Formula One\ncalendar for 2009.\nIn August 2009, Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone remarked that there was no immediate plan to\nreturn Formula One to the United States, vowing \"never to return\" to Indianapolis.[50] Nevertheless, shortly\nbefore the first race of the 2010  season, Ecclestone continued to fuel speculation that a return to\nIndianapolis was not out of the question.[51]\nVarious efforts were made to try to bring the race to the New York City region. In March 2010, Ecclestone\nannounc ed plans to bring a Formula One race to New York City for the 2012  season. Ecclestone was\nquoted as saying the race would take place across the Hudson River in New Jersey, with the Manhattan\nskyline overlooking the circuit.[52] In May 2010, plans emerged for a circuit to be built in Jersey City's\nLiberty State Park,[53][54] but those plans were abandone d shortly thereafter.[55] A race in West New York\nand Weehawken was later announc ed in October 2011. In May 2010, it was announc ed that Monticello\nMotor Club in upstate New York\u2014a  circuit complex modeled on a private country club near Monticello\u2014\nhad submitted a bid for the rights to hos t the race.[56]\nOn May 25, 2010, Austin, Texas, was awarded the race on a ten-\nyear contract, as Ecclestone and event promoter Full Throttle\nProduc tions agreed to a deal beginning in 2012 . The event is being\nheld on a purpose-built new track, which was named Circuit of the\nAmericas (COTA).[57] German architect and track designer\nHermann Tilke designed the new track on 800 acres (320 ha) of\nland to the east of the city.[58] In July 2010, promoter Tavo\nHellmund promised that the circuit would be one of the \"most\nchallenging and spectacular in the world\" and that it would include\na selection of corner sequences inspired by \"the very best circuits\"\nin the world.[59]\nOn November 15, 2011, it was reported that construction of the circuit had been temporarily halted as the\nowners had not yet been awarded the contract to stage the race in 2012,[60] following reports that Bernie\nEcclestone had cast doubt  on the race taking place.[61][62][63] After Tavo Hellmund's contract was found in\nbreach by Ecclestone[64] and a new contract was entered into between Formula 1 and the original track\ninvestors, Red McCombs and Bobby Epstein, the US Grand Prix was confirmed to be held at the Circuit of\nthe Americas in Austin on the original scheduled date in 2012.[65][66] Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel\ntook pole for the first race at the Texas circuit but it was 2007 winner Lewis Hamilton who kept his\nunbe aten run in the US as the two finished almost 40 seconds  ahead of third.\nOn November 11, 2015, the Texas gove rnment cut nearly $6 million of the required $25 million in funding\nto host the event.[67] Attendance numbers had droppe d to 224,01 1 in October 2015, for the 2015 United\nStates Grand Prix event, after heavy rain from a quickly dissipating Hurricane Patricia.[68] On March 9,\n2016, it was confirmed the race would continue to run in Austin, despite the funding cuts. 2016 turned out\nto be the best-attended Grand Prix in Austin: boos ted by a heated World Drivers' Championship battle\nbetween Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, good weather, and the allure of a Saturday night concert fromAustin (2012\u20132019, 2021\u2013)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3543, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "205488d5-8d0a-4b92-b865-b40756eb67b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "205488d5-8d0a-4b92-b865-b40756eb67b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12f55430-b369-4f67-bca9-588d524f3c16", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "United_States_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "bad76e6c554fee76603e2eea17df19eab03cedc59d3894ffefc84927dff812b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Drivers' Parade at the 2021 USGPpop singer Taylor Swift, nearly 270,000 people went through the\nturnstiles during the race weekend.[69] On October 22, 2017, Lewis\nHamilton won the race.

Previously, how ever, there were four other separate F1 events there.\nFrom 1976  until 1983 , the Long Beach circuit hosted a newly created United States Grand Prix West,\nwhich ran in the same seasons as the United States Grand Prix (East). The United States was thus the first\nnation since Italy in 1957  to hold two Formula One Grands Prix in the same season. During the years\n1976 \u20131980  when both Grands Prix ran, the United States Grand Prix was also referred to as the United\nStates Grand Prix East. The Caesars Palace Grand Prix ran as a Formula One World Championship race in\nLas Vegas in 1981  and 1982  (after which it continued two further years as an event in the CART series).\n1982  saw the inaugural Detroit Grand Prix in the center of Detroit, Michigan, which ran until 1988 . The\n1982  Formula One season thus featured three Grands Prix in the United States\u2014the first time in World\nChampionship history that a country hosted more than two Grands Prix. Finally, a one-off Dallas Grand\nPrix in Fair Park, Texas, was held in 1984 ; it was plagued by problems with the track surface, exacerbated\nby extremely hot 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C) July weather.[76] After these short-lived events, the historical United States\nGrand Prix returned in 1989  at Phoenix and until 2022 remained the only Grand Prix on the F1 calendar to\nbe held in the United States, despite changing locations a few times since.\nA potential new Grand Prix in the New York City area was announc ed for the 1983 season, to be held\neither at the Meadowlands Sports Complex, Meadow Lake in Flushing Meadows, or Mitchel Field in\nHempstead, Long Island (on the same site as the 1936 and 1937 Vanderbilt Cups).[77][78] However, the\nrace was first postpone d and then cancelled,[79] as CART started their own race at the Meadowlands, and\ntitled it the \"United States Grand Prix\".[80] The most serious effort to date to bring a Grand Prix to New\nYork City was the Grand Prix of America at the Port Imperial Street Circuit, which was included on the\npropos ed 2013 calendar but was then cancelled. In 2022, the first Miami Grand Prix was held at the Miami\nInternational Autodrome, a track specifically designed for F1, located around the Hard Rock Stadium in the\nMiami suburb of Miami Gardens, Florida.
