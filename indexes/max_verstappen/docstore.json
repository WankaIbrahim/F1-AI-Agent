He has a\ndatabase in his head which he can use immediately. Even with data, Gasly and Albon could see where he was faster, but\nthey could never grasp how he was faster there. That's because what makes Verstappen so good is mainly unconscious.\"\nAccording to Mitchell, those years of training and driving on his intuition has made it impossible for other drivers to\nmeasure up to Verstappen.[286]\nHelmut Marko asserted that Verstappen's progress has moved him clear of his former Formula 1 team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, in both qualifying and race trim.\n\"There is specific data,\" Marko told Autosport, \"In qualifying the gap to Ricciardo is greater. The strange thing is Max sometimes slides more, but still manages to\nkeep the tyres alive.\" Verstappen previously mentioned that he was three or four-tenths faster on average than \"very fast qualifier\" Daniel Ricciardo.[287] Marko\nconcluded that then 20- year-old Verstappen \"clearly moved away\" from Ricciardo since the \"second ha lf of the 2018 s eason.\"[288]\nFollowing his maiden Formula One win, at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix, three-time Formula One World Champion Niki\nLauda described Verstappen as the \"talent of the century.\"[289] Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner stated that\nVerstappen is the best driver Red Bull have ever seen: \"I have no doubt  [Verstappen is] the best we have seen on one of our\ncars, in terms of outright raw ability and commitment. He's the best driver we\u2019ve seen.\"[290]\nFormer Formula One driver Gerhard Berger echoed Jenson Button's recent comments, anointing Max Verstappen as the\nFormula One driver of this era with the most raw talent. Speaking to Sport1, Berger ventured: \u201cWhen it comes to raw\ntalent, Max Verstappen is the most talented of all. But it\u2019s not just about raw talent, it\u2019s about the whole package. That\nmeans it\u2019s not just about setting the fastest laps but also to win a race. And not just [about] one race but many and\neventually a championship, and championships.\"[291]\nTwo-time Formula One World Champion Fernando Alonso commented that Verstappen is the standout  driver in Formula\nOne, declaring the Red Bull star to be \"one step ahead\" of everyone . Alonso noted that Verstappen deserved to win the\nFormula One drivers\u2019 championship in Abu Dhabi, ahead of the title decider that saw the Dutchman and Lewis Hamilton enter level on points: \u201cMercedes lately\nhave been more performing and they\u2019ve won a couple of races now, but Max is driving \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 one step ahead of all of us. We saw the [qualifying] lap\nin Jeddah, until he touched the wall at the last corner, that lap was coming from Max, not the Red Bull.\"[292] Former Formula One Driver Karun Chandhok\nlikened Verstappen's ruthless and uncompromising attitude in race combat to Michael Schumacher's unyielding and iron-willed style of racing.[293] Verstappen was\nranked first in the annua l Formula One team principals\u2019 top ten drivers ranking in 2021.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4050, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8de20ee6-e906-4620-bd1d-f13a7e69435d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8de20ee6-e906-4620-bd1d-f13a7e69435d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "max_verstappen.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5087f113-511e-4613-aa26-fb300d3e1563", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "max_verstappen.pdf"}, "hash": "68a5c17102d1b9c809c8654232e02c9565f7b76a776bdeb5f508e1b5773b54c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13519499-3f03-42ec-96f3-c8237b3ec902", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "max_verstappen.pdf"}, "hash": "14108fae31f01f68df13ab26da6c909a14ad7ba293387085e9d2c52dbd0e0852", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Alonso noted that Verstappen deserved to win the\nFormula One drivers\u2019 championship in Abu Dhabi, ahead of the title decider that saw the Dutchman and Lewis Hamilton enter level on points: \u201cMercedes lately\nhave been more performing and they\u2019ve won a couple of races now, but Max is driving \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 one step ahead of all of us.

W hat the frickin' heck were any of  us doing at 18?\"[296]\nDespite earning high praise and acclaim from Formula One drivers and experts in and out of the sport, Verstappen faced criticism in the wake of the penalties he\nincurred during the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. Following this race, former Formula One driver Martin Brundle wrote: \"Such is [his] car control and cunning,\nhe's sometimes able to pull off the audacious moves and leave a margin of doubt  as to whether it's hard racing or simply a professional foul outside of the\nregulations and it's those moments which are generating the confusion, controversies and inconsistencies. Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher had their faults\ntoo, and I was on the receiving end from both of them on occasions, but it's a sizeable dent on their immense reputations, not a positive.\"[297] Following an\nimpressive first half of the 2022 season, journalist David Tremayne claimed Verstappen had elevated himself to a new higher level compared to his 2021 title\nwinning season, sugge sting V erstappen's first title had made him more relaxed and \"chirpy\".[298]\nVerstappen has accumulated a significant fanbase from around the world, but in particular from his home country of the\nNetherlands. Grand Prix events have dedicated Verstappen grandstands with thousands of travelling Dutch fans, boosting\nticket sales particularly for European races such as Belgium, Austria and Hunga ry.[299] During the 2021 Dutch Grand Prix,\nHonda 's Formula One managing director Masashi Yamamoto praised the Verstappen suppor ters, saying that \"in the six\nyears I've been involved with Honda  F1, I've never seen such a great turnout as at the Dutch Grand Prix. It was like being\nin a football stadium.\" He added that \"when Max crossed the finish line first, the whole circuit coloured orange\".[300]\nIn 2021, Verstappen was voted the most popul ar Formula One driver in an official survey.[301] He has a fan made song,\n\"Super Max!\" performed by Pitstop Boys.
