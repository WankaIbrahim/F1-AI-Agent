This\nmarked the first front-row start for Williams since the 2017 Italian Grand Prix.[103] The race was delayed by wet weather\nand ultimately only two laps were completed, both unde r safety car conditions. This allowed Russell to maintain his grid\nposition and claim his first Formula One podium finish.[104] At the Italian Grand Prix, Russell finished ninth, scoring an\nadditional two points. At the Russian Grand Prix, Russell qualified in third in mixed conditions, before finishing the race in\ntenth.[105] This would be his final points finish of the year.

He jumped out of his car to check on Zhou Guanyu, whose car had\nflipped over the tyre barrier and was resting upside-down against the catch fence.
