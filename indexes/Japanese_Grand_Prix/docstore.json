Japan was the only Asian\nnation to host a Formula One race (including\nthe Pacific Grand Prix) until Malaysia joined\nthe calendar in 1999 .\nThe first two Formula One Japanese Grands\nPrix in 1976 and 1977 were held at the Fuji\nSpeedway, before Japan was taken off the\ncalendar. It returned in 1987 at Suzuka,\nwhich hosted the Grand Prix exclusively for\n20 years and gained a reputation as one of the\nmost challenging Formula One circuits. In\n1994 and 1995, Japan also hosted the Pacific\nGrand Prix at the TI Circuit, making Japan\none of only nine countries to host more than\none Grand Prix in the same season (the others\nbeing Austria, Bahrain, France, Germany,\nGreat Britain, Italy, Spain and the USA). In\n2007 the Grand Prix moved back to the\nnewly redesigned Fuji Speedway.[1] After a\nsecond race at Fuji in 2008, the race returned\nto Suzuka in 2009, as part of an alternating\nagreement between the owners of Fuji\nSpeedway and Suzuka Circuit, perennial\nrivals Toyota and Honda . However, in July\n2009, Toyota announc ed it would not host\nthe race at Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond due to a downturn in the global econom y,[2] and so the\nJapanese Grand Prix was held at Suzuka instead. Suzuka has hosted the Japanese Grand Prix every year\nsince 2009, apart from in 2020 and 2021 when the Grands Prix were cancelled due to the COVID-19\npandemic.[3][4]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2415, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cad6ed2c-a7a2-47f7-a799-308712a585f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "cad6ed2c-a7a2-47f7-a799-308712a585f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "72185dc6-0429-4279-a150-f984db6b4881", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "6f724d498bfbd0c5e0139f52961eaccbbbaa12578ea4b8cef9a007f9aecb7980", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Prince R380 (1966)\nNiki Lauda's Ferrari 312T2\n(1976)\nRonnie Peterson's Tyrrell P34\n(1977)The event is due to take place at the Suzuka Circuit until at least 2029.[5]\nThe first Japanese Grand Prix was run as a sports car race[6] at the Suzuka\nCircuit 80 kilometres (50 mi) south west of Nagoya  in May 1963. In\n1964, the race was held at Suzuka again. This marked the beginning of\nmotor racing in earnest in Japan. For the next eight installments, however,\nthe non-championship Grand Prix was run at the Fuji Speedway, 40 miles\n(64 km) west of Yokoha ma and 66 miles (106 km) west of the Japanese\ncapital of Tokyo . At the time, the circuit (which was actually an\nincomplete circuit) featured Daiichi, the opening banked turn, which was\nthe scene of many fatal accidents (removed in 1974) . It was then run as a number of disciplines of\nmotorsports, particularly Formula 2, sports cars and Can-Am-type sprint racing.\nThe first Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix, in 1976, was held at the very\nfast 2.7-mile Fuji Speedway, minus the banking. The race was to become\nfamous for the title decider between James Hunt and Niki Lauda as it was\nheld during monsoon conditions. Lauda, who had survived a near-fatal\ncrash at the German Grand Prix earlier in the season, withdrew from the\nrace stating that his life was more important than the championship, as did\nBrazilians Emerson Fittipaldi and Carlos Pace.

The circuit, set inside a funfair, was designed\nby Dutchman John Hugenholtz and owned by Honda , who used it as a test track. Most notable initially for\nits layout\u2014Suzuka is the only figure-eight race track to appear on the F1 calendar\u2014the demanding and fast\nJapanese circuit became very popul ar among drivers and fans, and it was to see some of the most dramatic\nand m emorable moments in Formula One history.\nThe first event in 1987 was already a classic. It immediately saw another World Title decided, as Nigel\nMansell crashed his Williams-Honda  heavily in practice at the Snake Esses and consequently could not start\nthe race due to aggravating an old back injury he had received in his Formula Ford days, effectively\nhanding the title to his teammate Nelson Piquet; the 3rd and final title of his career. Austrian Gerhard Berger\nwon the race for Ferrari, their first victory since 1985.\nSuzuka played a part in the feud between Frenchman Alain Prost and\nBrazilian Ayrton Senna. This long battle reached immense levels of\ncontroversy and media coverage; this struggle was between two men who\nwere both considered to be by far the best drivers in Formula One at that\ntime.\nThe 1988 race was a World Championship decider between Senna and\nProst \u2013 who were McLaren teammates that year. Senna came in with a\ngreater chance of winning the championship, as the points system in those\ndays counted the best 11 results; Senna had retired from one more Grand\nPrix than Prost had and had been slightly less consistent than the\nFrenchman, yet this was actually to the Brazilian's advantage; the way the points system worked in those\ndays meant that there was more room for him to score points. McLaren also had obtained superior and fuel-\nefficient Honda  engines from Williams, had a car far better than any of the others, and had won every race\nof the season except the Italian Grand Prix \u2013 McLaren's only doubl e retirement of the season. At the start,\nSenna made a very bad start, stalling on the grid but then managing to bump-start his car on the down-\nsloping pit straight. As a result, he droppe d to 14th, while Prost took the lead. It then began to rain, and wet-\nweather specialist Senna stormed around  the track, setting a number of fastest laps and passing car after car\nuntil he caught Berger in 2nd and then started to catch Prost rapidly. The Frenchman's gearbox was\nmalfunctioning, and the Brazilian caught and passed Prost while the Frenchman was delayed by consistent\nbackmarker Andrea de Cesaris. Senna won the race and hi s first Drivers' Championship with Prost finishing\n2nd, de spite the latter scoring m ore points overall.\nThe 1989  race was a highly anticipated race, and even with new regulations banning turbo-charged\nengines, the McLaren-Honda  combination was still dominant, they had won 10 of 14 races so far in the\nseason. This race turned out to be one of the most memorable in the sport's history. Prost and Senna, once\nagain McLaren teammates for 1989, were both embroiled in an acrimonious personal feud that had started\nat the second race of the season and their relationship was, come the race weekend, at such a low point it\nwas virtually non-existent. Very unus ual for teammates of a racing team, there was almost zero\ncommunication going on between Prost and Senna, and was to the degree where the McLaren team were\neffectively running as 2 separate teams \u2013 with 4 to 5 times more people around Senna than Prost.

Both Senna and\nProst went into the race weekend each knowing what the stakes were. Prost was 16 points ahead of Senna,\nand the Brazilian was facing nearly insurmountable odds : he had to win at Suzuka to stand any chance of\nstaying in contention of winning the championship going into the next race, which he was obliged to win as\nwell. Senna qualified on pole position 1.5 seconds  ahead of Prost who was already working on his race\nsetup in qualifying. Senna's set up meant he was faster around corners, while Prost opted for a set up that\nmade him faster on the straights.\nCome race day, the two McLarens were on the front row of the grid, and both McLaren drivers' emotions\nwere running very high. As the starting lights flashed to green, Prost made an excellent start and jumped\ninto the fast first corner ahead of Senna. The two McLaren drivers immediately started to pull away from\nthe rest of the field, with Prost and Senna setting the pace at the highest possible level they could muster. On\nlap 47, going through the ultra-fast 130R  corner, the Brazilian attempted an ambitious pass going into the\nCasio chicane. Senna was in an awkward position to pass, being on the inside of his teammate, and tried to\nshove  his way past Prost, but the Frenchman decided to be true to words he had said to Senna and M cLaren\nboss Ron Dennis: he would not leave the door open as he had before and give up the position simply for\nMcLaren to be embarrassed by a doubl e retirement. And Prost did exactly that: as he turned into the right\nhanded turn that made up the first part of the chicane, he turned into Senna, and the Frenchman's car hit the\nBrazilian's car and the two cars were interlocked and both slid off the track and up the chicane's escape\nroad, the Honda  V10 engines in bot h cars stalling.\nProst and Senna were both beached and Prost got out of his car promptly, know ing he had won the\nchampionship with Senna's apparent retirement whilst Senna waved towards a group of Suzuka's track\nmarshals, who ran up to the two interlocked cars. So they could separate the two cars, the marshals pushed\nSenna's car backwards onto the track, which put it in a dangerous position. The marshals then pushed his\ncar forwards while Senna bump-started the engine, and he drove off. Even after being stalled for more than\n30 seconds, the furious pace he and Prost had been running at put them both so far ahead of the rest of the\nfield that Senna was still leading the race comfortably in front of Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini.\nSenna's front nose cone was damaged and going through the Degner bend, it came off; and he pitted to\nhave it changed. Nannini had passed Senna while the Brazilian was in the pits, and after he stormed out of\nthe pits, Senna drove as furiously as he had before, and within 2 laps while making up 2.5 seconds a lap on\nNannini he caught and passed the Italian cleanly at the Casio chicane. Senna took the chequered flag, but\nthe podi um ceremony pr oceeded to be delayed. A meeting be tween Senna, Prost, the McLaren management\nand FIA officials including the very unpopul ar FIA and FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre took place\nimmediately post-race. It was thought  that Senna was going to be disqualified for receiving external non-\nteam assistance, which was against the rules, but that rule had a loophol e: the rule read that if a driver was\ndeemed to be in a dangerous position, they could be push started.

Prost had won the Drivers' Championship for the third time \u2013 but  this was\nnot official until Senna's retirement from the Australian Grand Prix 2 weeks later, before which McLaren's\nappeal had been denied.\nThe 1990 event proved to be just as controversial as the 1989 event. Senna and Prost were once again first\nand second in the championship \u2013 the two men had won 37 of the past 46 Formula One championship\nraces. But the roles had been reversed: the championship situation for Prost was the same as Senna's in the\nprevious year. The Frenchman needed to win both of the final two races to defend the title. The race also\nwas without defending champion Nannini, as his career ended just days after a helicopter crash. As shown\nin a video of the pre-race drivers' briefing,[9] the drivers were discussing w hat was to be done  if a car was in\na dangerous position at the Casio Chicane. Senna was appalled at what he saw as a ridiculous interpretation\nof badly thought -out rules \u2013 and he walked out of the meeting as it was taking place. Senna qualified on\npole position, three-tenths ahead of Prost, now driving for Ferrari, who had the next most competitive\npackage that year behind McLaren. Senna requested to change the grid positions in order to move pole\nposition to the cleaner left side of the road, where the racing line was. This was granted, but Balestre\nintervened and reverted the grid positions back to their original locations, meaning pole position would be\non the dirty right side of the track, where all the bits of tire rubbe r had been thrown from the tires by the\nFormula One cars. This meant Senna was off the racing line and it would be more difficult for him to make\na better start. Frustrated and angry, Senna mimicked Prost's statement of the previous year saying he would\nnot move over if Prost attempted to overtake in the first corner. Senna started from pole, with Prost second\n(albeit on the racing line). Prost got ahead of Senna \u2013 but the more powerful Honda  engine in Senna's\nMcLaren meant that he was able to make up a bit of ground. Prost moved over to take the racing line, but\nSenna dived into the corner to Prost's right to pass him \u2013 and as a result he hit the side of Prost's Ferrari.\nBoth cars went straight on a nd bot h drivers sped through t he gravel trap at 160 m ph (260 km /h) and crashed\ninto the tyre wall at the end of the run-off area. Senna and Prost were both unhur t, and neither driver\nbothered to check to see if the other was okay. This accident meant that Senna won his second world\nDrivers' Championship. The crash looke d somewhat dubious, and nothing was done  to Senna by the FIA;\nbecause they had done nothing to Prost in 1989 for crashing to Senna, they could not do anything to Senna\neither, with the collision being declared a \"racing incident\" in the end. Furious and disgusted, Prost later\ndescribed Senna as \"a man without value\". Both drivers have been accused of crashing into the other\ndeliberately and thus the two situations as well as their comments after both incidents have tainted both\ndrivers' reputations in the eyes of most but die-hard fans. Benetton driver Nelson Piquet won his first race in\n3 years after Gerhard Berger went off and Nigel Mansell's Ferrari failed in the pits after a pit stop, and\nPiquet's new teammate Roberto Moreno finished 2nd.\n1991 was yet again the showdown for the Drivers' Championship, and it saw Senna and this time Mansell\nin a competitive but rather unreliable Williams battle for the Drivers' Championship. Prost did not  win a race\nin his uncompetitive Ferrari that year and it turned out to be his last race for the Scuderia that year; he was\nfired from the team after the race for describing the 643 as having handling like \"a truck\". This was the last\nstraw for Ferrari; as Prost had been making unsavory comments about the Italian team for some time. The\nrace started, and Mansell went off at the first corner on lap 10, and Senna won his 3rd Drivers'\nChampionship in 4 seasons.

He\nretired from the race, as did Senna, and Mansell's teammate Riccardo Patrese took his only victory that year.\n1993 was an interesting event; Senna took the lead from Alain Prost (who had won his 4th drivers' title at\nthe previous race) and kept it; additionally, the changeable weather conditions played to Senna's advantage,\nwho was know n to be exceptional in wet-weather conditions. He was harassed, however, by Briton\nnewcomer Eddie Irvine, who attempted to pass Senna and unlap himself while battling with Prost's British\nteammate Damon Hill. Senna won his 40th race in his career from Prost, but he wasn't all smiles. He sought\nout Irvine, had a heated discussion with the Northern Irishman and punc hed him in the side of the head;\nthen Senna went on live television for post-race interviews, and used profanity on the live recording in\nfrustration at Irvine, other drivers' alleged bad behavior on the track and at the media, who he claimed were\n\"irrespons ible\" for sensationalizing some of Senna's dangerous on-track behavior.\nBy 1994, Prost had retired and Senna was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix, and the Japanese GP that\nyear saw Hill and German Michael Schumacher battle for the Drivers' Championship. Hill crucially won\nthe race ahead of Schumacher; Suzuka was hammered by a torrential downpour  which made conditions\nvery difficult for Hill as Schumacher was an acknow ledged specialist in wet-weather conditions. 1995 saw\nan incredible drive from French-Italian Jean Alesi on dry slick tyres in damp conditions. It had rained at the\nstart; but the track was drying. Alesi went into the pits on lap seven, around the time everyone  else came in.\nThe French driver began to lap Suzuka in his Ferrari 5 seconds faster than anyon e else, and when he came\nout of the pits, he was 17th \u2013 but then over the course of 18 laps climbed to 2nd place, passing car after car\nwhile a number of the other cars changed to slick tyres as well. But then Alesi had to serve a drive-through\npenalty for jumping the start. This did not stop the emotionally highly-strung Alesi: he droppe d down to\n10th, but pushed hard; and began passing car after car. He then went into the pits and droppe d to 13th from\n8th as a result. Then he had gone  off in the last corner on lap 20 but recovered, and as a result droppe d\nfurther down the order to 15th. He then went from 15th to 9th in one lap and got into 2nd again behind\nSchumacher, whom he caught up to and battled with for the lead. This remarkable performance was only to\nlast 5 laps, however: Alesi's Ferrari's driveshaft failed as a result of his excursion earlier and he retired from\nthe race.

The tire caused Schumacher's retirement three laps later,\nleaving H \u00e4kkinen to take victory and hi s first drivers' championship.\nHakkinen then won his second consecutive drivers' title in 1999, after a\nfight with Eddie Irvine, Schumacher's Ferrari teammate.\nThe next 5 events were all won by Ferrari; Schumacher won in 2000\u2013\n2002 and 2004, and his teammate Rubens Barrichello won in 2003. Schumacher won his 3rd title at the\n2000 event: he took advantage of his superior speed in damp conditions during a mid-race rain shower to\nsecure the race win and his first World Championship title for Ferrari. This was Ferrari's first drivers'\nchampionship in 21 years. Ferrari completed their domination of the 2002 season by reaching a total points\ntally of 221 points on the then-used 10-point scoring system. At the 2003 event, Schumacher endured one\nof the most trying races in his career, needing to come at least eighth, he started at fourteenth on the grid \u2013\nbut managed to secure the point he needed to take his sixth World Drivers' Championship, beating the\nrecord held by Juan Manuel Fangio. Schumacher had an incident-filled race, having a collision with\nTakuma Sato and another near collision with his brother. The qualifying session for the 2004 event, which\nwas due to be held on 9 October, was postpone d until race day after a typhoon  hit Suzuka. This led to the\nidea of holding qualifying sessions on a Sunda y morning (an idea that was abandone d half-way through the\nfollowing ye ar).\nThe 2005 race was one of the most exciting races of the season after many top drivers started near the back\nof the grid after the qualifying in variable weather. McLaren driver Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n won the race after\nstarting from 17th place, overtaking Renault driver Giancarlo Fisichella at the beginning of the last lap \u2013\nafter Fisichella was blocked by a backmarker. At the 2006 event, Michael Schumacher led until an engine\nfailure virtually ended his chances of an eighth championship, which went to Spaniard Fernando Alonso.\nIt was announc ed on 24 March 2006 by the FIA that future races will again be held at the redesigned Fuji\nSpeedway (now owned by Toyota) in Oyama, Sunto District, Shizuoka  Prefecture.[10] The news of the\nJapanese Grand Prix moving to the circuit redesigned by Hermann Tilke was met with some trepidation, as\nthe Honda -owned Suzuka was a favorite of many of the drivers and Hermann Tilke's tracks had received\nmixed reviews from the drivers and the fans.\nOn 8 September 2007, it was announc ed that Fuji will alternate the\nJapanese Grand Prix with Suzuka, starting from 2009 onwards.[11] The\n2007 race was held in torrential rain and started behind the safety car.\nLewis Hamilton took the victory while his McLaren teammate Fernando\nAlonso crashed heavily. Heikki Kovalainen finished 2nd, his best result\nuntil that date and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n 3rd, marking the first time that two\nFinnish drivers were together on the podium.

Felipe Massa was 7th after a penalty for a\ncollision with title rival Lewis Hamilton, while Hamilton finished outside the points, having also served a\npenalty for an incident in the first corner.\nIn July 2009, Toyota cited a global econom ic slump as the reason that the\nJapanese Grand Prix would not return to Fuji Speedway in 2010 and\nbeyond. The speedway argued, according to the Associated Press, that\n\"continuing to host F1 races could threaten the survival of the company\".\nAs a result, the 2010 Grand Prix was held at Suzuka, at which point it\nwas announc ed that Suzuka would have exclusive hosting dut ies.[12]\nBoth the 2009 and 2010 races were dominated by Red Bull and Sebastian\nVettel, with Red Bull finishing 1\u20132 both years. Sebastian Vettel secured\nhis second World Championship in the 2011 Grand Prix with a third-place\nfinish, while McLaren's Jenson Button (the only driver in the field who had a theoretical chance of beating\nVettel to the title) won the race wearing a special tribute helmet to the people affected by the 2011 T\u014dhoku\nearthqua ke and tsunami. The helmet featured a design in the style of the Japanese flag, and he auctioned the\nhelmet off afterwards to raise money for those caught in unfortunate circumstances during the times of the\ntsunami earlier that year.\nKamui Kobayashi took third place at the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix, after\nenduring race-long pressure from Jenson Button. Kobayashi became the\nfirst Japanese driver to finish on a Formula One podium in Japan in 22\nyears, after Aguri Suzuki in the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix, and was the\nthird Japanese driver to finish on a Formula One podium after Suzuki and\nTakuma Sato in the 2004 U nited States Grand Prix.[13]\nThe 2013 race was won by Sebastian Vettel for Red Bull, marking his\nfourth consecutive victory of the season as well as his fourth victory\noverall at Suzuka. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber, who started the race\non pole position, finished second behind his teammate, with Romain Grosjean taking the final podium\nposition for Lotus.\nIn 2014 , a typhoon  struck the circuit during the race weekend, causing controversy over the late-afternoon\nstart time not being moved. The race saw both the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton duel\nwith each other for the lead, with Hamilton ultimately taking victory ahead of his teammate and Sebastian\nVettel. However, the race was marred by tragedy. On lap 45, Adrian Sutil in the Sauber spun off the track at\nthe Dunlop Curve, and as his car was being recovered by a crane, Jules Bianchi in the Marussia spun off\ntrack at the same area and smashed horrifically into the crane. The race was red flagged immediately\nfollowing the accident as conditions were deemed too dangerous to race. Bianchi was unresponsive to\nmarshals and team radio. He was taken to a nearby hos pital, where he was placed into a coma. It was hope d\nthat he would recover, but Bianchi died nine months later due to his injuries. This led to changes to the\ncircuit for the next year, with drainage gutters being created at the Dunlop Curve to allow water to runoff\nfaster during a rainstorm, as well as the moving of a similar crane to prevent accidents such as Bianchi's\nfrom occurring in the future.Return to Suzuka", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3373, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "027e2eb9-8afc-4f85-86c4-45ababddba4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "027e2eb9-8afc-4f85-86c4-45ababddba4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bcb79d2-0ca9-4391-b1bb-d3c9fea715c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "2f2d3d47984e8b9b1c70d709080c5368a34875cffe4785f66dbae5ac179051da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On 23 August 2013 it was announc ed that the contract for the Japanese Grand Prix had been extended until\n2018.[14] A further extension was announc ed in August 2018 to keep the race at Suzuka until 2021. But the\n2020 e dition, due  to be held on 1 1 October, was cancelled on 12 J une due to the COVID-19 pa ndemic.[15]\nThe 2022 Japanese Grand Prix, held on 9 October 2022, was the first held at Suzuka since 2019 . The race\nsaw a delayed start due to torrential rain, which when the race began would lead to Carlos Sainz Jr.\ncrashing his Ferrari and the race being red-flagged. 28 laps were run. Before the race was suspended, the\nFIA dispatched a recovery vehicle while the race was unde r doubl e yellow flag conditions, which meant\nthat the vehicle was on the track at the same time as the Formula One cars themselves - leading to a near-\nmiss incident for Pierre Gasly, who at that time was driving for Scuderia AlphaTauri and had collided with\nan advertisement board, meaning that he had to make a quick pit stop and had to catch up to the safety car\ntrain, narrowly missing the vehicle. This was sharply criticised by drivers as Gasly's compatriot Jules\nBianchi had lost his life due to a similar incident in 2014.[16][17][18]\nThis race also saw some confusion regarding the awarding of points; it was widely believed that\nchampionship leader Max Verstappen would earn half points (19 instead of 25) due to less than 75% of the\nscheduled race distance being completed, which would mean he was one point short of claiming the\nchampionship. However, full points were awarded instead and Verstappen became the 2022 Formula One\nWorld Champion; he himself showed surprise when he found out that full points were awarded.[19] This\nconfusion was a result of a rule change implemented for 2022 which was introduc ed in respons e to the rain-\ndisrupted 2021 Belgian Grand Prix.[20] For the 2023 season, the points-awarding system was altered to\nutilise the sliding scale system to determine the points being given, regardless if it finishes unde r red or\ngreen flag conditions.[21]\nOn 5 July 2023 it was announc ed that the Japanese Grand Prix has been moved from its traditional\nSeptember/October date as it was in previous years, to a slot in April for the 2024 calendar, between the\nAustralian Grand Prix and the returning Chinese Grand Prix as part of F1's regionalisation efforts.[22]\nFrom its return to the Formula One calendar in 1987 , the Japanese Grand Prix has become one of the most\npopul ar with spectators. For the 1990 race, three million fans entered a draw for the 120,000 available\ntickets, due to the popul arity of Honda 's world championship successes as an engine supplier to the\nWilliams and McLaren teams, the fact that the country had produc ed its first full-time F1 driver in Satoru\nNakajima, and Ayrton Senna's immense popul arity in Japan. After Nakajima's retirement in 1991  and\nHonda 's withdrawal from competition the following year, interest went into decline despite the addition of\nthe Pacific Grand Prix to the F1 calendar, an event also held in Japan during the 1994  and 1995  seasons.\nThe 1995 Japanese Grand Prix was the first for which the allocated tickets did not sell out.[23]\nSubsequently, the appearance of new Japanese drivers such as Takuma Sato and the entry of Honda  and\nToyota as full manufacturer teams has restored the event to its former popul arity. However, Honda  and\nToyota left Formula One in 2008 and 2009 respectively, with both teams citing econom ic reasons. Honda\nreturned to Formula One as an engine supplier for McLaren in 2015, a partnership that lasted until 2018.\nHonda  began supplying engines for Toro Rosso (later know n first as AlphaTauri and secondly as RB) in\n2018, and Red Bull Racing in 2019, before leaving Formula One again after the 2021 season.
