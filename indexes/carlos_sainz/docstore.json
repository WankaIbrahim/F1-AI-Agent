He ultimately finished 0.4 seconds  behind Gasly to take his second podium and what was at the time\nhis career best race finish.[63] Sainz retired from the next two races; he was involved in a multi-car start-line accident at the Tuscan Grand Prix and then crashed\ninto a wall on the first lap of the Russian Grand Prix.
