First held by the Royal\nAutomobile Club (RAC) in 1926 , the British\nGrand Prix has been held annua lly since 1948  and\nhas been a round of the FIA Formula One World\nChampionship every year since 1950 . In 1952 ,\nfollowing the transfer of the lease of the Silverstone\nCircuit to the British Racing Drivers' Club,[1] the\nRAC delegated the organisation of races held at\nSilverstone to the BRDC,[2] and those held at\nAintree to the British Automobile Racing Club.[3]\nThis arrangement lasted until the RAC created the\nMotor Sports Association in the late 1970s  and it\nreclaimed organising control of the event. The\nRAC MSA was renamed Motorsport UK in 2019\nwhen it formally split from the RAC.\nThe British Grand Prix is currently held at the\nSilverstone Circuit near the village of Silverstone in\nNorthamptonshire in England. The 2019 event was\nthe 70th time that the race had been run as a World\nChampionship event since the inaugural season in\n1950 , and the 53rd time that a World\nChampionship round ha d been held at Silverstone.\nThe British race is the oldest in the Formula One\nWorld Championship calendar as the 1950 race at\nSilverstone was round one of the first\nchampionship season in 1950 . It and the Italian\nGrand Prix are the only two Formula One World\nChampionship Grands Prix that have been staged\nduring every season that the championship has\nbeen held. The British Grand Prix was a round of\nthe World Manufacturers' Championship in both\n1926 and 1927, but was never held during the existence of the European Championship. It was designated\nthe European Grand Prix five times between 1950 and 1977, when this title was an honor ary designation\ngiven each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe.

I t was the first purpose-built motor racing ve nue, as well as one of the first airfields in the\nUnited Kingdom . Grand Prix motor racing first came to Britain in 1926, following the successes of Henry\nSegrave in winning the 1923 French Grand Prix and the San Sebasti\u00e1n Grand Prix the following year, both\nin a Sunbe am Grand Prix car, which raised interest in the sport domestically and demonstrated to the\nAIACR that the advances made in the British motor indus try merited the honour  of hosting an international\ngrand prix motor race. The first ever British Grand Prix (officially know n as the Grand Prix of the Royal\nAutomobile Club) was held at Brooklands on 7 August 1926[5] and was won by Robert S\u00e9n\u00e9chal and\nLouis Wagner driving a Delage 15 S 8.[6] The second Grand Prix of the RAC was also held at Brooklands,\non 1 O ctober 1927,[7] and w as again won by a  Delage 15 S  8, this time driven by Robert Benoist.\nSeveral non-championship races know n as the Donington Grand Prix were held at Donington Park in\nLeicestershire near Derby which attracted the best European teams in 1937  and 1938 , where the German\nMercedes and Auto Unions dominated the proceedings. The German Bernd Rosemeyer and the Italian\nTazio Nuvolari (both driving mid-engined Auto Union cars) won this race in 1937 and 1938, respectively,\nbut as the races were organised by the Derby & District Motor Club[8] rather than by (or on behalf of) the\nRoyal Automobile Club, they are not usually accorded the \"British Grand Prix\" title.\nBrooklands had been severely damaged by the onset of World War II and the circuit was abandone d. Most\nnew British circuits were being built on disused Royal Air Force airfields, and Silverstone, located on the\nNorthamptonshire/Buckingha mshire border in central England equidistant between London and\nBirmingha m (the latter being the capital of the UK produc tion car indus try)- was one of those circuits. It\nstaged its first race, the Royal Automobile Club International Grand Prix on 2 October 1948, which was\nwon by Italian Luigi Villoresi in a Maserati. In 1949, the circuit was heavily modified and made very fast;\nand it remained in this configuration for decades.\nIn 1950, the World Championship of Drivers was introduc ed, and the 1950 British Grand Prix was the first\nWorld Championship Formula One race ever held, with new regulations and 6 other races in Europe. This\nrace was won by Alfa Romeo driver Giuseppe \"Nino\" Farina. King George VI was among the attendees of\nthe race. The 1951 race was particularly exciting, as it was the first F1 race not won by an Alfa Romeo; the\ngas-guzzling Italian cars were beaten by another Italian car- the more fuel-efficient Ferrari of Argentine Jos\u00e9\nFroil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez in what was the famed Scuderia's first ever Formula One victory. For the 1952 event, the\noriginal pits between Abbey and Woodc ote were abandone d and demolished. A new pit complex was\nconstructed between Woodc ote and Copse corners; Alberto Ascari dominated this and the next year's race;\nGonz\u00e1lez won again in 1954 i n a Ferrari.History\nBrooklands (1926\u20131927)\nSilverstone (1948\u20131954)\nSilverstone and Aintree (1955\u20131962)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3357, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e67c33d6-295e-4111-a5f6-18902d3fe10b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e67c33d6-295e-4111-a5f6-18902d3fe10b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "British_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d39ab552-e1ce-4536-a8cc-b36cf3a3335e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "British_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "45ab20bb65e1af7c2abd093032188e4392271134f3e4630e03b2437e417f3299", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "10f01671-5267-41f0-8513-2e7f83f9aace", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1257ee94d77291b15a4751c8ff0aaf1bf19cf461dd147a1843d308a4fcc3bdd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In 1955, the Formula One circus began to alternate between Silverstone and the Aintree circuit, located on\nthe Grand National horse racing course near Liverpool.

This was the first Grand Prix\nvictory for a British-built car- Formula One would soon be mostly made up of British teams. 1958 was\nwhen Peter Collins won in a Ferrari and Bernie Ecclestone was entered in a Conna ught but his car was\ndriven by Jack Fairman, and 1959 and 1960 saw Australian Jack Brabham win in a mid-engined Coope r.\nThe last race at Aintree was in 1962 when Briton Jim Clark won his first of 5 British Grands Prix; Aintree\nwas decommissioned in 1964.\n1964 saw the first Formula One race at the southern English circuit know n as Brands Hatch, located in\nancient woodlands in Kent, just outside London . The track was built in the early 1950s  and had been\nextended in 1960 to include the new Grand Prix course. Silverstone hosted the British Grand Prix in odd-\nnumbered years and Brands Hatch in even-numbered years. Like Silverstone, the circuit was popul ar with\ndrivers, and unlike the flat Northamptonshire circuit and Aintree, Brands Hatch had many cambered corners\nand va rying elevation. L ike the year before at Silverstone, Clark won the 1964 r ace and the next year's race.\n1967 saw Clark take yet another dominant win, and 1968 saw a monum ental battle between Swiss Jo\nSiffert in a Lotus and New Zealander Chris Amon in a Ferrari; Siffert won the race, his first of two victories\nin F1 on t he circuit where he would lose his life in a non- championship race three years later.\n1969 saw another big battle between home favourite Jackie Stewart and Austrian Jochen Rindt, that went\non for a while; although Rindt had a loose rear wing and had to come into the pits to get it repaired; Stewart\ntook the chequered flag driving a Ford/Cosworth-powered Matra for Ken Tyrrell. Rindt won the 1970\nevent at the expense of Brabham running out of fuel at the end of the race, and 1971 saw Stewart win again\nin a Tyrrell (Ken Tyrrell had started building his own cars). 1973, however, saw a huge  first lap accident at\nWoodc ote that took out 11 cars, including all three works Surtees cars. Amazingly, there were no deaths or\nany fires and the worst news was that Andrea de Adamich received career-ending ankle injuries. 1974 saw\nAustrian up-and-comer Niki Lauda dominate the race in his Ferrari, however, a rear-tire punc ture slowed\nhis car and rivals Jody S checkter and E merson Fittipaldi passed Lauda to take 1st and 2nd.\n1975 saw a chicane added to Woodc ote to slow cars going through the very high-speed corner; and this\nwas another race of variables as a rainstorm hit the track and a number of drivers including Scheckter and\nBriton James Hunt hydroplaned off the track at the same corner; Fittipaldi won the race after it was called\nshort.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3812, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10f01671-5267-41f0-8513-2e7f83f9aace": {"__data__": {"id_": "10f01671-5267-41f0-8513-2e7f83f9aace", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "British_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d39ab552-e1ce-4536-a8cc-b36cf3a3335e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "British_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "45ab20bb65e1af7c2abd093032188e4392271134f3e4630e03b2437e417f3299", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e67c33d6-295e-4111-a5f6-18902d3fe10b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "British_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "74d9f0cf448e6572786662bdd1444e050ad985bddf5211eacc3a652dad5d539c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Amazingly, there were no deaths or\nany fires and the worst news was that Andrea de Adamich received career-ending ankle injuries. 1974 saw\nAustrian up-and-comer Niki Lauda dominate the race in his Ferrari, however, a rear-tire punc ture slowed\nhis car and rivals Jody S checkter and E merson Fittipaldi passed Lauda to take 1st and 2nd.\n1975 saw a chicane added to Woodc ote to slow cars going through the very high-speed corner; and this\nwas another race of variables as a rainstorm hit the track and a number of drivers including Scheckter and\nBriton James Hunt hydroplaned off the track at the same corner; Fittipaldi won the race after it was called\nshort. 1976 also saw changes to Brands Hatch including making the fearsome Paddoc k Hill bend a bit\ntamer, South Bank corner more of a left-hand apex rather than a long hairpin and moving Bottom Straight\nfurther south so that the pits and paddock area could be expanded.

Silverstone,\nwhich was already a very fast circuit, was becoming faster and faster and the cars were lapping the circuit in\nthe low 1-minute range. The race was an exciting one with Brazilian rising star Ayrton Senna making a\ngreat start from 4th and taking the lead by the first corner. He led until late in the race when his car was\nrunning out  of fuel while Prost was pushing hi m hard; Senna eventually ran out  of fuel and Prost went on to\ntake victory. 1986 saw a huge  crowd thanks to Mansell being a favourite to win; his newly found fame and\nplace in a competitive team would help the British Grand Prix to see huge  crowds for several years. This\nrace saw 42-year-old Jacques Laffite get involved in a first corner accident and slam head-on into the\nbarriers, breaking both his legs and ending his Formula One career. Nigel Mansell, whose car broke at the\nstart of the first race, got into his teammate Piquet's spare car and won the race; although this was the last F1\nrace at Brands Hatch. A number of people had concerns about the speeds of the cars on the small track;\nparticularly the European Grand Prix held at Brands Hatch the previous year.[9] The southern English\ncircuit was getting to be very fast- now with these 1,000 hp (750 kW)-plus, 1,180 lb (540 kg) cars, pole\nsitter Piquet's average qualifying speed was 226.085 km/h (140.483 mph) and his lap time was in the 1\nminute 6-second r ange, compared to the 1 minute 20-second r ange in 1976.

Silverstone and\nthe BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with Formula 1 and FISA at some point in 1986, to run from\n1987 t o 1993.[10]\n1987 saw Silverstone modified; the Woodc ote chicane was no longe r used and a new left-right chicane was\nbuilt on the Farm Straight just before Woodc ote. Silverstone's layout, like Brands Hatch, had changed little\nsince 1949. The circuit was still fast, and it saw Mansell charge after Piquet (who had decided to run the\nwhole race on one set of tyres) and the British driver broke the lap record 11 times, caught and passed\nPiquet and took victory; the Silverstone crowd broke ranks and ran onto the circuit after the race was over;\nthis was to start a number of dramatic events surroundi ng Mansell for the next 5 years. 1988 saw Senna win\na rain-soaked event, and Mansell finished 2nd after driving very hard and passing many cars to attempt to\ncatch Senna; this was one of Mansell's two race finishes that season. 1989 s aw Prost win in a McLaren after\nhis teammate Senna went off at Becketts; Mansell finished 2nd again driving for Ferrari; and sometime after\nthe event, it was decided that Silverstone, the fastest circuit on the Formula One calendar, was to be heavily\nmodified, and the project would be completed for 1991. The 1990 Grand Prix was the last motor race on\nthe high-speed circuit; and Mansell drove hard and led a lot of the race; but gearbox problems eventually\nforced him to retire, where he threw his gloves into the crowd and announc ed that he was going to retire, a\ndecision that he would later take back; and he effectively dominated the next two events, driving for\nWilliams. The circuit was now more technical, 15 percent slower and every corner on the circuit except\nCopse was different. It also included an infield section right before the pits. After 1992, Mansell had retired\nfrom F1, and 1993 saw new Williams driver Damon Hill lead much of the race until his engine blew up,\nand H ill's French teammate Alain Prost took hi s 50th career Grand Prix win.\nAfter the tragedies of Imola in 1994, a chicane was installed at the flat-out Abbey corner 6 weeks before the\nevent was due to take place and Stowe corner was slowed considerably. Hill won the event, something his\ndoubl e world champion father Graham never did. 1995 saw another British driver, Johnny Herbert, take\nvictory in his Benetton. 1996 saw further changes to the circuit, where Stowe was more or less restored to\nits 1991 design, and the 1999 event saw doubl e world champion Michael Schumacher crash heavily at\nStowe; he broke his leg, missed many races and this put him out of championship contention. There were\nattempts to bring the British GP back to Brands Hatch for 2002, but  this never materialised.\nThe 2003 event was disrupted by a defrocked priest, Cornelius Horan, who ran onto the Hangar Straight\nduring the race while cars were coming at him at over 260 km/h (160 mph). Marshals were able to get him\noff the track before he hurt himself or anyone  else and he was later arrested; Brazilian Rubens Barrichello\nwon the race for Ferrari. A dispute between Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club\n(BRDC), and the Formula One authorities in 2003 over the funding of necessary improvements to the\ntrack's facilities led to doubt s over the future of the race. In October 2004 the British Grand Prix was left off\nthe preliminary race schedule for 2005 because the BRDC refused to pay the race fee demanded by Bernie\nEcclestone. However, after months of negotiation between the BRDC, Ecclestone and the Formula One\nconstructors, a deal was made for the Grand Prix to be held at Silverstone until 2009. 2008 saw Briton\nLewis Hamilton win in pouring rain for McLaren; Hamilton and Jenson Button's presence and success in\nFormula One helped to see huge  crowds at Silverstone not seen since Nigel Mansell's time in the sport.
