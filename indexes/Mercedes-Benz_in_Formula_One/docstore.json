for various periods since\n1954. The current Mercedes-AMG\nPetronas F1 Team is based in Brackley,\nEngland,[4] and possesses a German\nlicence.[5] An annou ncement was made in\nDecember 2020 that Ineos planned to take\na one third equal ownership stake\nalongside the Mercedes-Benz Group and\nToto Wolff;[6] this came into effect on 25\nJanuary 2022.[7] Mercedes-branded teams\nare often referred to by the nickname, the\n\"Silver Arrows\" (German: Silberpfeile).\nBefore the Second World War, Mercedes-\nBenz competed in the European\nChampionship, winning three titles. The\nmarque debuted in Formula One in 1954 .\nAfter winning their first race at the 1954\nFrench Grand Prix, driver Juan Manuel\nFangio won another three Grands Prix to\nwin the 1954 Drivers' Championship and\nrepeated this success in 1955 . Despite\nwinning two Drivers' Championships,\nMercedes-Benz withdrew from motor\nracing after 1955 in response to the 1955\nLe Mans disaster.\nMercedes returned to Formula One in\n1994  as an engine manufacturer in\nassociation with Ilmor, a British\nindependent high-performance autosport\nengineering company, which developed\ntheir engines. The company won one\nconstructors' title and three drivers' titles\nin a works partnership with McLaren\nwhich lasted until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor\nwas rebranded as Mercedes AMG High\nPerformance Powertrains. In 2010 , the\ncompany bought  the Brawn GP team,\nrebranding it as Mercedes.

The manufacturer has also collected more than 200 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One\nhistory. Ten Constructors' and thirteen Drivers' Championships have been won w ith Mercedes-Benz engines.\nMercedes-Benz formerly competed in Grand Prix motor racing in the 1930s , when the Silver Arrows dominated the races\nalongside rivals Auto Union. Both teams were heavily funde d by the Nazi regime, winning all European Grand Prix\nChampionships after 1934, of  which Rudolf Caracciola won three for Mercedes-Benz.[8]\nIn 1954, Mercedes-Benz returned to what was now know n as Formula One (a World\nChampionship having been established in 1950)  unde r the leadership of Alfred Neubauer,\nusing the technologically advanced Mercedes-Benz W196.[9] The car was run in both the\nconve ntional open-wheeled configuration and a streamlined form, which featured covered\nwheels and wider bodyw ork. Juan Manuel Fangio, the 1951 champion, transferred mid-\nseason from Maserati to Mercedes-Benz for their debut at the French Grand Prix on 4 July\n1954. The team had immediate success and recorded a 1\u20132 victory with Fangio and Karl\nKling, as well as the fastest lap (Hans Herrmann). Fangio went on to win three more races\nin 1954, w inning the championship.\nThe success continued into the 1955  season, with Mercedes-Benz developing the W196 throughout  the year. Mercedes-Benz again\ndominated the season,[9] with Fangio taking four races, and his new teammate Stirling Moss winning the British Grand Prix.\nFangio and Moss finished first and second in that year's championship.
