The road was later conne cted to other roads\nopening access coastal defence positions.[1]\nAfter the war some of these roads were widened and\nlinked together and a racing circuit was designed, not as\nlegend has it by John Hugenholtz, but rather by a group\nof officials from the Royal Dutch Motorcycle\nAssociation, with advice from Bentley Boy Sammy\nDavis, who had won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1927 . The\nfirst race took place in 1950 .[1] The edition, along with\nthe 1951  event, was held as non-championship Formula\nOne races, with Louis Rosier winning bot h years.\n1952  was the year the Dutch Grand Prix was part of the\nthird Formula One World Championship; this and the\nnext year's races were won by Italian Alberto Ascari.

The 1956 and 1957 races were cancelled because of apparent lack of money, which was indirectly\ncaused by the 1956\u2013 1957 Suez Crisis. The 1958 Dutch Grand Prix was won by Moss in a Vanwall. 1959\nsaw Swede Jo Bonnier win his only Formula One championship event and 1960  saw Dan Gurney have an\naccident and a spectator was killed; the race was won by Jack Brabham in a Coope r.\nFrom 1963  to 1965  saw Briton Jim Clark win all three events, and 1967  saw the introduc tion of the Lotus\n49 with its brand new Ford-Cosworth DFV engine. The DFV won on its debut with Clark driving; this\nengine became the most successful and widely used engine among private teams until 1985. The 1970\nevent saw the 49's successor, the 72, win comprehensively with Jochen Rindt behind the wheel. However,\ntragedy struck during the race: Briton Piers Courage, driving for Frank Williams, crashed heavily near the\nnotoriously fast Tunne l Oost corner after a wheel came off and hit him on the head, which killed him. The\ncar, with Courage still in it, then caught fire and burned to the ground. The 1971  event saw Jacky Ickx win\nin a Ferrari after a spirited battle with Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a BRM in rain-soaked conditions. There\nwas no 1972 race. It was originally on that year's calendar, but the drivers refused to race at Zandvoor t,\nbecause the facilities and conditions of the circuit were out-of-date with Grand Prix racing at that time.\nZandvoor t had been extensively modified dur ing its absence from the Grand Prix calendar. It had been lined\nwith Armco and the cars were protected from the sand dune s and track-side obstacles. New pits were built,\nand the circuit also saw a chicane placed before Bosuit, the very high-speed corner that went into the pit-\nstraight. For the 1973  race, in an indirect celebration of the efforts put forth, there was a special atmosphere\nat that weekend and everyone  was happy, especially the organizers. But in a cruel twist of fate, that race\nwas to be yet another black mark on Zandvoor t's history and reputation. In a race that was thought  to be\none of the most well organized Grands Prix yet seen, it was actually disorganization and a total lack of clear\ncommunication that would be ultimately respons ible for what was to happen. On the eighth lap of the race,\nBriton Roger Williamson (in only his second ever Formula One race) crashed heavily near Tunne l Oost and\nhis car caught fire while scraping along the tarmac. Williamson was uninjured during the crash; but time\nwas running out; he could not free himself from the car. Williamson's countryman David Purley stoppe d\nalongside, crossed the track and ran over to the burning March. Purley tried in vain to turn the car upright.\nThere appeared to have been ample time to right the car and pull Williamson out, but as desperately as he\ntried, Purley was unable to do it by himself, and the marshals, who were not wearing flame retardant\noveralls, were unable and unwilling to help due to the intense heat. Race control assumed that it was\nPurley's car that had crashed and that the driver had escaped unha rmed. Many drivers who saw Purley\nwaving them down to stop assumed that he was trying to put a fire out from his own car, having safely\nexited it, and thus did not know  that a second driver had been involved. As a result, the race continued at\nfull pace while Purley desperately tried to save the life of Williamson. Due to a group of race officials\nstanding around Williamson's burning car doing absolutely nothing to help and even hindering the situation\n(by throwing away the fire extinguisher Purley was using over the Armco and down a slope), this did not\nwork, and Williamson died not of skin burns but of asphyxi ation.

Andretti attempted ambitiously to pass Hunt at the\n180-degree Tarzan corner; the two cars touched and both were out of the race. Andretti won the 1978\nrunning; his last Formula One victory. 1979  saw a change to the circuit to slow cars coming into Tunne l\nOost; there was a high-speed temporary chicane put there. Canadian Gilles Villeneuve had crashed there\nwhile battling ferociously with Australian Alan Jones and damaged his left-rear suspension. Though he\ncarried on, at the start of the next lap he went off again at Tarzan. Refusing to give up, Villeneuve, to the\nshock of many, went into reverse gear and drove his Ferrari out of the muddy run-off area and back onto\nthe circuit. About halfway around the next lap, the car's left rear rim, wheel, and suspension totally shattered\nand was dragged by the car as it went along, making the Ferrari nearly impossible to drive. Villeneuve,\ndisplaying his now legendary car control, made it back to the pits without crashing or going off and retired\nfrom the race; the Grand Prix was won by Jones. 1980  saw the chicane removed and replaced by a slower\nchicane before Tunnel Oost. 1981  saw a big battle between Frenchman Alain Prost in a Renault and Jones\nin a Williams; Prost came out on top to win. The 1982  event was won by Frenchman Didier Pironi in a\nFerrari; his countryman Ren\u00e9 Arnoux  had a dreadful crash at the end of the pit straight going into Tarzan;\nhis front suspension failed on his ground- effect Renault and he went head on into the barriers; fortunately\nhe was uninjured. 1983  saw a battle between championship contenders Prost and Brazilian Nelson Piquet.\nProst attempted to pass Piquet at Tarzan but the Frenchman punted Piquet off and Prost crashed soon\nafterwards. Prost won from pole in 1984 . In 1985 , Lauda took his 25th and final Grand Prix victory while\nholding of f his charging McLaren teammate Prost near the end of  the race.\n1985 was the race's final running, as the company that ran the circuit (CENAV) went out of business,\nmarking the end of the old Zandvoor t circuit. The track, owned by the municipality of Zandvoor t, was not\nused for some time and part of the grounds and approximately half of the track was sold in 1987 to\nVendorado, a bunga low park developer at that time.[3] The track was eventually redesigned and is still used\nfor other disciplines of motorsport.\nOn 14 May 2019, the Dutch Grand Prix at the Zandvoor t track was announc ed for the 2020  Formula One\ncalendar.[4] In March 2020 the return of event was postpone d in respons e to the COVID-19 pandemic; it\nwas later cancelled altogether with the event's return slated for 2021 , where hom e favourite Max Verstappen\ntook t he victory.
