Since 2013, it has been the\nGrand Prix held the most times, with 93 editions\nas of 2023 . It is one of the two Grands Prix\n(along with the British) which has run as an\nevent of the Formula One World Championship\nGrands Prix every season, continuous ly since the\nchampionship was introduc ed in 1950. Every\nFormula One Italian Grand Prix in the World\nChampionship era has been held at Monza\nexcept in 1980 , when it was held at Imola.\nThe Italian Grand Prix counted toward the World\nManufacturers' Championship from 1925 to\n1928 and toward the European Championship\nfrom 1931  to 1932 and from 1935 to 1938. It\nwas additionally designated the European Grand\nPrix seven times between 1923 and 1967, when\nthis title was an honor ary designation given each\nyear to one Grand Prix race in Europe. Four\neditions before the World Championship were\nheld in places other than Monza: Montichiari\n(1921 ), Livorno (1937 ), Milan (1947 ) and Turin\n(1948 ).\nThe event is due to take place at the Monza\nCircuit until at least 2025.[1]\nThe first Italian Grand Prix took place on 4 September 1921 at a 10.7- mile (17.3 km) circuit near\nMontichiari.[2] However, the race is more closely associated with the course at Monza, a racing facility just\noutside the northern city of Milan, Italy's second largest city in its largest metropolitan area, its econom ic\ncapital and Alfa Romeo's home.

The\ncircuit was 10 km (6.25 miles) long, with a flat banked\nsection and a road circuit combined into one. It was fast,\nand always provided excitement. The 1923 race\nincluded one of Harry A. Miller's rare European\nappearances with his single seat \"American Miller 122\"\ndriven by Count Louis Zborowski of Chitty Chitty Bang\nBang fame. Zborowski was killed at the following year's\nGrand Prix at Monza driving a Mercedes.\nThe 1928 race was the first of many tragedies that befell\nthis venue. Italians Emilio Materassi in a Talbot and\nGiulio Foresti in a Bugatti were battling around the fast\ncircuit. As they came off the banking onto the left side of\nthe pit straight at 125 mph (200 km/h), one of the front\nwheels of Materassi's overtaking Talbot touched one of\nthe rear wheels of the Bugatti. Materassi lost control of\nthe car, swerved left, cleared a 15-foot wide and 10-foot\ndeep ditch and ploughed into the unprotected grandstand\noppos ite the pits, killing himself and 27 spectators, and\ninjuring another 26. It was the worst accident in motor\nracing history and remained so until the 1955 24 Hours\nof Le Mans. The Italian Grand Prix went on a three-year\nhiatus (but the alternative non-championship Monza\nGrand Prix was run in 1929 and 1930)  until the 1931 race, held in late May instead of the traditional early\nSeptember, was won by Giuseppe Campari and Tazio Nuvolari, sharing an Alfa Romeo. The 1931 race\nwas something of an endurance race; it took ten hours to complete. The great Nuvolari won again in a\nshortened 1932 r ace, this time held in early June.\nIn 1933 , with the race being held this time at the traditional timeframe of early September, disaster struck\nagain. Three top drivers were killed during the course of the Monza Grand Prix, a Formula Libre race held\nover three heats and a final in the afternoon of 10 September, after the Italian Grand Prix itself had been\nheld in the morning, on what became known as the \"Black Day of Monza\".[3] During the second heat,\nthere was a reported patch of oil on the south banking that had come from a Duesenberg, driven by CountAutodromo Nazionale di Monza\nThe black day of 1933", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "913e8a62-2e8f-4156-8657-2d7111ac12b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "913e8a62-2e8f-4156-8657-2d7111ac12b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce2762e5-4bdf-4f8c-ba17-1cc72dfdb68a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "cd4fc06276c6ef2902eed919ce3a3008301b49f0eab64f8027e283488f9e462f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1933 posterCarlo Felice Trossi, and Giuseppe Campari in a Ferrari-entered Alfa\nRomeo and his protege Baconin Borzacchini in a Maserati were\nalready battling ferociously; and Borzacchini and Campari went\nthrough the south banking on the first lap, wheel to wheel.\nBorzacchini went through the oily patch, lost control, spun wildly\nand the Maserati then overturned and violently flipped multiple\ntimes, and by the time the wrecked car came to a stop, Borzacchini\nwas pinned unde rneath and was being crushed by his car, not\nhaving been thrown out. And while Borzacchini's Maserati had\nbeen crashing all over the track, Campari swerved to avoid him,\nand by doing this, his car went up and flew off the banking and\ncrashed into trees situated right next to the track. Campari broke his\nneck and was killed instantly, and Borzacchini died later that day in\na Monza hospital.\nPrior to the final, there was a drivers meeting to discuss the oil\npatch, and it was decided to clean it up. On the eighth lap, Polish\naristocrat Count Stanislas Czaykow ski was on the south banking\nwhen his Bugatti's engine blew up, and a fuel line then broke. The fuel from the Bugatti's tank caught fire\nafter touching the very hot front section of the Bugatti where the engine and gearbox were and the burning\nfuel sprayed onto Czaykow ski. Blinded by the smoke and flames on him, he went up and flew off the\nbanking- at the same spot where Campari and Borzacchini had crashed. The Polish driver, unable to put out\nthe flames on his body which was fuelled by the fuel from his wrecked Bugatti, then burned to death.\nFrenchman Marcel Lehoux  in a Bugatti was declared the winner of the shortened event.[3]\nEnzo Ferrari, who had been close to Campari and Borzacchini; the former deciding to defect from Ferrari's\nteam to Maserati, became hardened by this tragedy. Today, racing historians conclude that the events of this\nrace marked a watershed, notably for Enzo Ferrari. It was the end to the joyful era of racing and the\nbeginning of a harsher new age. Safety in those days was completely non-existent. The circuit's condition\nwas virtually identical of that to an ordinary town and country road, except instead of the surface being\nmade of dirt and/or tarmac, it was made of tarmac, concrete and/or bricks. Spectators often stood very close\nto or even next to the track and they had no protection of any kind other than common sense. What was\nparticularly tragic about the 41-year old Campari's death was that he had announc ed his retirement at the\nFrench Grand Prix two months earlier, to focus on hi s opera singing exploits.[4]\nAfter the disastrous 1933 race, something had to be done  to Monza. In 1934 a short version of Florio\nCircuit (introduc ed in 1930 for Monza Grand Prix) was used: the drivers had to start from the main straight\nbut taking the south curve of the high speed ring (interrupted by a doubl e chicane) in the oppos ite direction\ncompared to the usual one; then, through the conne ction introduc ed a few years before by Florio, they took\nthe central straight, the south curve (also interrupted by a chicane) and the main straight; finally a 180 \u00b0\nhairpin turned back to the finish line. This configuration was considered too slow and since the following\nyear Florio circuit (with five chicanes) was used. These races were at a time when Mercedes and Auto\nUnion became involved in motor racing; the German Silver Arrows won all of these races; with superstar\nRudolf Caracciola winning in 1934  and in 1937  when the Italian Grand Prix was held at a street circuit inThe Florio circuit and other locations", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3605, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f93af45b-412c-4fb7-8149-b7fa8cff5c2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f93af45b-412c-4fb7-8149-b7fa8cff5c2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b71a0d58-65b9-41d0-9245-1a2b3e17023e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "41199a906d2edbc53be998417c7959270792b624b3444ee38abd0eef35a70473", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1953 GP race startLivorno. 1938  saw a return to Monza, which was won by Nuvolari driving a mid-engined Auto Union; just\nafter the race renova tion w orks began but  in 1939 World War II broke out and the Italian Grand Prix did not\nreturn unt il 1947.\n1947  saw the Italian Grand Prix being held at a fairgrounds  park in the city of Milan's district of Portello,\nand this race was won by Italian Carlo Felice Trossi driving an Alfa Romeo. Italian Giovanni Bracco went\noff the road in his Delage and crashed into a group of spectators, killing five. This venue was never used\nagain for racing, and 1948  saw it being held in Valentino Park, a public park in Turin. The 1949 race\nreturned to Monza where it stayed for the next 30 years with the configuration ready before the war but\nnever used yet.\nMonza's banking had been built over and only the road circuit was used, which had been modified slightly.\nThe new long, fluid final corner was now two around 90-degree corners. 1949 saw Italian new-boy Alberto\nAscari, son of the late 1924 Italian Grand Prix winner Antonio Ascari, win in his Ferrari; Enzo Ferrari was\nnow building hi s own cars instead of running Alfa Romeos. 1950  saw the new Formula One Championship\nbeing established. The race and the first championship was won by Giuseppe \"Nino\" Farina, driving a\nsupercharged Alfa Romeo 158. 1951  saw Ascari win again, after the competitive Alfas of Farina and\nArgentine Juan Manuel Fangio ran into engine problems. 1952  saw Ascari complete his domination of that\nseason. 1953  Fangio won in a Maserati; although Ascari had already won the championship at the Swiss\nGrand Prix. 1954  turned out to be an interesting race; as up-and-comer Stirling Moss in a Maserati passed\nboth Fangio's Mercedes and Ascari's Ferrari. The furious pace saw the retirement of Moss and Ascari and\nFangio went on to win while Moss pushed his Maserati 250F  over the line.\nAfter the 1954 running, work began on entirely\nrevamping the circuit. New facilities were built and a\nnew corner, the Parabolica, was built right before the\npits. Extra track used for a short course was eliminated.\nThe biggest change was the construction of the new\nMonza banking. Built on top of where the almost flat,\nnarrow original banking was, these huge  concrete\nbankings, called the sopraelevata curves, were built in\nthe same shape as the original banking had been. The\nonly significant difference was that the Curva Sud was\nmoved slightly to the north. This course was combined\nwith the road course for the 1955 event, which was won\nby Fangio and was the last race contested by a full-\nfledged Mercedes factory effort in Formula One until 2010. The 10 km Monza circuit was now so fast that\nF1 cars were averaging 135+  mph per lap- though rather unremarkable by today's standards, these average\nspeeds were even faster than the Indianapolis Speedway oval in the United States. 1956  saw an exciting\nrace, with championship contenders Fangio, Briton Peter Collins (both in Ferraris) and Frenchman Jean\nBehra in a Maserati fight over the win. Stirling Moss was already out of championship contention; and\nFangio retired with a broken steering arm. The Ferrari team called for Italian Luigi Musso to hand his car\nover to Fangio. Musso ignored the order so Collins came in and handed his car and his championship\nchances to Fangio. Behra had retired early with a magneto problem in his own car and took over his\nteammate Umberto Maglioli's car; but he retired that car, too. Musso ended up leading after Moss ran out ofMonza's redevelopments (1949\u20131979)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3568, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95e1869f-13ab-4681-8d19-31b56767b6fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "95e1869f-13ab-4681-8d19-31b56767b6fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f6fab7bc-cc84-4346-884a-cbb9c3c2b825", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "012e1929637658860c42d07000693d42ec67b20a649dad2b4327be35a7c63fed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The end of 1971 GPfuel coming through Vialone.

Fangio took s econd a nd hi s fourth Drivers' Championship.\n1957  saw the organizers choos e to use the road circuit only, as the rough, poorly constructed banking had\ncaused problems for the Ferrari and Maserati cars the year before. Moss won again in a Vanwall, and Briton\nTony Brooks won next year's race, and Moss won the 1959  event in a Coope r-Climax. 1960 , however was\nnot so straightforward. Ferrari with their front-engined cars, had lost out to the advanced mid-engined\nBritish cars. Seeing an oppor tunity, the Italian organizers decided to re-include the banking with the road\ncircuit, making Monza even faster and more in favour to the powerful Ferraris. The British teams were\nunha ppy as they cited the fragility of the banking, which was extremely rough, had a concrete surface\ninstead of asphalt, was of very poor quality and was suppor ted by stilts rather than solid bedrock; the\nargument being that it was too dangerous for Formula One cars. The British teams boyc otted the race, so\nFerrari had no competition. American Phil Hill took victory, in what was the last victory for a front-engined\nFormula One car.\n1961  saw a return to the combined circuit, but it was to see yet another tragedy. Two Ferrari drivers, Hill\nand German count Wolfgang von Trips, came into the race with a chance at winning the championship.\nFighting for fourth place while Hill was leading and while von Trips approached the Parabolica, the Briton\nJim Clark slightly moved over into the path of the German and the two collided. Von Trips crashed into an\nembankment next to the road and then went flying into a crowd of people standing on it. Von Trips was\nthrown out of his car and was killed, as were 14 spectators. Clark survived but was hounde d by Italian\npolice for months after the incident. Hill won the race and the championship by one point. The race was not\nstoppe d, allegedly to assist rescue work for the injured.\n1962  saw a return to the road circuit only and the\nbanking was never used again for Formula One. It still\nstands, but in decrepit condition for a long time before\nbeing restored in the early 2010s ; the last time it was\nused was in 1969 for the 1000 kilometre sports car race\nthat year. Briton Graham Hill won the race, and won the\nDrivers' Championship in South Africa soon afterward.\n1963  saw an attempted use of the extremely fast full\ncircuit again, and the drivers ran the course during\nFriday practice but the concrete banking was so rough\nand bumpy that cars were being mechanically torn apart.\nIt was feared that there would be no finishers for the race\nitself. Briton Bob Anderson's Lola crashed after losing a wheel on the banking, although he was not\ninjured); the drivers then threatened to walk off unless they raced on the road circuit only, which is what\nhappened. Jim Clark won the race in a Lotus. Ferrari driver John Surtees won in 1964 , and Briton Jackie\nStewart won his first of 27 Grand Prix victories in 1965 , driving for BRM. Against team orders, he fought\nhard with his teammate Graham Hill, Hill made a mistake at the Parabolica and Stewart was in command;\nthis was all to the chagrin of team boss Tony Rudd. 1966  saw Italian Ludovi co Scarfiotti win, and no other\nItalian has won the race since. 1967  was to be a race of interest and was to produc e the first of three close\nfinishes on the fast Monza circuit over the next four years.

With\nthis win, Stewart won his first of three championships.1970  saw Rindt's fatal crash during qualifying at the\nwheel of his rear wing-less Lotus; his car suffered brake shaft failure, veered off the track, hit and went\nunde r the improperly-secured guardrail on the left and spun multiple times.

The 1971 race was the fastest Formula One race ever at that point in time. It\nwas really just a bunc h of straights and fast corners and F1 cars had become increasingly advanced and\nmuch faster, and the drivers were constantly slipstreaming each other around the circuit. A small chicane\nwas put at the end of the pit straight and another one at the Vialone curve; Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi won\nthat race and his first Drivers' Championship at only 25 years of age. His chief rival Jackie Stewart went out\nat the start with a broken gearbox. In 1973 , Stewart punc tured a tire early in the race and went into the pits\nto have it changed; he came out in 20th place and finished fourth in the race while Fittipaldi finished\nsecond; this was enough for Stewart to win his third and final Drivers' Championship. 1974  saw further\nchanges with the Vialone chicane changed and renamed Variante Ascari, which was the place where\nAlberto Ascari was killed in 1955 testing a Ferrari sportscar. Like the year before, Peterson won and\nFittipaldi finished second, now driving for McLaren. 1975 , however, was an event to remember. Ferrari,\nwhich had regroupe d completely unde r the leadership of Luca di Montezemolo, reached the high point of\nits resurgence.\nThe Ferrari camp was feeling relaxed while rising star\nand championship leader Niki Lauda was leading the\nDrivers' Championship, and the team was leading the\nConstructors' Championship. Fittipaldi and Argentine\nCarlos Reutemann had to win in order to have a chance\nat staying in the championship chase. When the race\nstarted, Lauda's teammate Clay Regazzoni took the lead,\nwith Lauda following; and Fittipaldi stormed round the\ncircuit in an effort to catch the two Ferraris. Fittipaldi\npassed Lauda for second but this did not matter as Lauda\nonly needed fifth to secure the drivers' title. Regazzoni\ntook victory, followed by Fittipaldi and Lauda, who won\nhis first drivers' title and Ferrari also won the Constructors' Championship at the same event. 1976  saw\nfurther changes to Monza's layout.

Peterson had crashed his car in practice, and had to use Andretti's spare car, not a comfortable\nfit for the tall Swede, in contrast to the diminutive American. As the race started, there was a huge , fiery\nmulti-car pile-up on the approach to the first corner. One of the victims was Peterson; his car slammed head-\non into the Armco barriers and had caught fire. Instead of the ill-equipped marshals, Briton James Hunt,\nwith the help of Frenchman Patrick Depailler and Regazzoni ran towards Peterson's aid and pulled him out\nof the burning Lotus. Peterson suffered severe leg injuries, and he died from embolism complications a day\nlater. With Peterson's retirement from the race, Andretti won the Drivers' Championship. The race itself was\nan interesting one; during the parade lap South African Jody Scheckter lost a wheel from his Wolf at the\nsecond Lesmo curve and hit an Armco barrier right next to the track. Andretti, Hunt, Lauda, Fittipaldi and\nReutemann went to inspect the damage, and they refused to start until it had been repaired; and it was\nrepaired in time; although t he race started well after it was suppos ed to. The cars were shown the green light\nwhile the back half of the field was still in motion (this often happened at Monza and it had happened\nduring the first start); and due to the visible excitement of the start official Andretti and Canadian Gilles\nVilleneuve jumped the start and were penalised a minute; Lauda went on to take victory in his Alfa-\npowered Brabham in a shortened race distance; it was getting dark by the time the checkered flag was\nshown to the Austrian driver. 1979  saw changes to Monza, run off areas were added to the Curva Grande\nand Lesmo corners and the track was upgraded. Scheckter, now driving for Ferrari, won the race and the\nDrivers' Championship.\nIn 1979, it was announced that the Autodromo Dino Ferrari, also know n as Imola, would host the Italian\nGrand Prix for 1980  while Monza unde rwent a major upgrade, including building a new pit complex. The\nImola circuit had been used for a non-championship event in 1979 and had hosted a variety of non-\nchampionship races since 1953;  this circuit was closer to the Ferrari factory in Maranello. Imola's one-time\nrunning of the Italian GP was won by Brazilian Nelson Piquet after the two turbo Renaults of Jean-Pierre\nJabouille and Ren\u00e9 Arnoux  retired.\nThe Italian Grand Prix returned to Monza for 1981, and\nit has stayed there ever since. The Imola circuit was not\nto leave Formula One, it hosted the San Marino Grand\nPrix from 1981 to 2006. The 1981 Italian Grand Prix\nwas won by rising star Alain Prost, and that race saw\nBriton John Watson have a huge  accident at the second\nLesmo Curve which also took out Italian Michele\nAlboreto.
