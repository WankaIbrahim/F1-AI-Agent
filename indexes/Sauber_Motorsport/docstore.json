Sauber returned in 2024\nas Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber,[1] and is set to be the Audi\nworks team from 2026  onwards, with the German outfit planning\nto acquire the Swiss team.\nHaving not won a Grand Prix as an independent, the team was\nrebranded to BMW Sauber in 2006 and competed as BMW Sauber\nfrom 2006  to 2009, finishing second in 2007 and third in 2008 in\nthe Constructors' Championship, and scoring their lone grand prix\nvictory at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. At the end of a less\nsuccessful 2009 season, BMW pulled out of Formula One and the\nteam's future remained uncertain for several months until total\ncontrol was handed back to Peter Sauber and granted a 2010 entry.\nDue to issues with the Concorde Agreement, the team remained as\n\"BMW Sauber\" for the 2010 season.[4][5] In March 2010, Peter\nSauber announc ed plans to change the team name but the FIA\nannounc ed that they would have to wait until the end of the\nseason.[6] At the beginning of the 2011 season, the team droppe d\nBMW from their name.\nUntil mid-2016, Peter Sauber held a controlling 66.6%  stake in the\nteam, with the remainder belonging to then CEO Monisha\nKaltenborn; she had been a leading figure in the team since\nBMW's withdrawal.[7] The team was sold during the 2016 season\nto Swiss investment firm Longbow  Finance S.A, with Pascal Picci\ntaking over Peter Sauber's role as chairman of the board and\npresident.[8] Audi bought  a minority stake in the team in January\n2023 in preparation of their Formula One entry.[9] The team\noperates in a 15,600 m2 (168,000  sq ft) facility in Hinwil,\nSwitzerland.[10]\nSports cars", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2532, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a10f1d8-e1d1-4159-bf23-772da1679374": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a10f1d8-e1d1-4159-bf23-772da1679374", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Sauber_Motorsport.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6d0c6ff5-556a-4be5-9da7-d349910c561f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Sauber_Motorsport.pdf"}, "hash": "6898a348e82777447e9a62731e2099eee90c84ea7c714bd008afbfc81cc1ec84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Engine Ferrari 066/12\nTyres Pirelli\nFormula One World\nChampionship career\nFirst entry 1993 South\nAfrican Grand\nPrix\nLast entry 2024 Belgian\nGrand Prix\nRaces entered 479 (476\nstarts)[N 1]\nEngines Sauber,\nMercedes, Ford,\nPetronas, BMW,\nFerrari\nConstructors'\nChampionships0\nDrivers'\nChampionships0\nRace victories 1[N 2]\nPodiums 27[N 4]\nPoints 865[N 5]\nPole positions1[N 3]\nFastest laps 5[N 6]\nSauber Motorsport AG\nFormerly PP Sauber AG\nRed Bull Sauber\nAG\nBMW Sauber\nAG[11]\nCompany\ntypePrivate\nIndustry Motor racing\nFounded 1970\nFounder Peter Sauber\nHeadquartersHinwil, canton of\nZ\u00fcrich, Switzerland\nKey people Mattia Binotto\n(COO & CTO)\nTeam Sauber-Mercedes achieved\nvictory at the 1989 24 Hours of Le\nMans with the Sauber-Mercedes C9.Peter Sauber began building sports cars in the 1970s. After using\nturbocharged Mercedes V8 engines in the 1980s , his team became\nthe official factory team of Mercedes-Benz, reviving the Silver\nArrow legend. The Swiss-German team[12] won the 24 hours of\nLe Mans (in 1989 ) as well as the World Sports Prototype\nChampionship (both in the 1989 season and 1990 season),\ncompeting against Jaguar and Porsche. Among others, drivers such\nas Michael Schumacher, Karl Wendlinger, Heinz-Harald Frentzen,\nJochen Mass, Jean-Louis Schlesser and Mauro Baldi raced for\nSauber.\nSauber participated in a number of other racing series before its\ninvolvement in Formula One, including the Swiss Sportscar\nChampionship and the World Sportscar Championship. The first\nSauber car, C1, was built in 1970. Sauber, in partnership with\nMercedes, won the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1989 and the World\nSports Prototype Championship in 1989 and 1990 with the Sauber\nC9 and Mercedes-Benz C11, respectively. Sauber also built a\nGroup 5 ve rsion of  the BMW M1.\nThe first 'turbo era' of\nFormula One ended with\nthe 1988  season. The 1.5-\nlitre turbocharged engines\nwere phased out in favour\nof naturally aspirated 3.5-\nlitre engines. Massive\ndemand for engine\nsuppliers and a constant\ninflux of new teams saw car manufacturers like Subaru, Porsche\nand Lamborghini enter Formula One as engine suppliers and\nsometimes buying out existing teams. Other projects never\nprogressed beyond design studies, such as one carried out by\nSimtek for BMW.

The\nteam was to be powered by V10 Ilmor engines in a chassis dubbe d\nthe C12, a continuation of Sauber's naming policy from sports car construction (the 'C' was a reference to\nPeter Sauber's wife Christine). It was to be driven by JJ Lehto and Karl Wendlinger.\nThe car's racing debut took place in the first race of 1993 , in South\nAfrica. The car was soon turning heads not only for its sharp\nFW14-like lines and striking black livery but its impressive\nperformance, claiming fifth place (two points unde r the scoring\nsystem at the time) on its Grand Prix debut. Despite this impressive\nentrance to the Grand Prix scene, over the remainder of the season\nthe team rarely saw the finish line due to unreliability and racing\naccidents. However, they proved their form was not a flash in the\npan recording a slow stream of points finishes and rarely finishing\noutside the top ten when they actually completed a race distance.\nDespite not achieving a podium, they ended the season with twelve\npoints, seventh out  of the thirteen original entries.\nThe team went into the 1994 season as Sauber Mercedes, now officially Mercedes's\nfactory-backed team with a new car in the Sauber C13 and the Ilmor engine rebadged\nthe Mercedes 3.5 V10. New team Pacific Grand Prix Ltd took a customer supply of\nmore dated Ilmor units. Between seasons Lehto had signed to Mild Seven Benetton\nFord. Former Sauber sports car driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen took up the role as Karl\nWendlinger's teammate.\nEarly signs showed the team was, rather disappointingly, delivering similar\nperformances to the previous year, scoring a small tally of points in the opening\nrounds . The season took a turn for the worse after a fourth place by Wendlinger\nfollowing the tragic deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San\nMarino Grand Prix. Just two weeks later, Wendlinger was seriously injured after\ncrashing in practice for the Monaco Grand Prix; losing control of his car unde r braking for the Nouve lle\nChicane. He suffered serious head injuries which left him in a coma for weeks and he was sidelined for the\nrest of the season. He was replaced by Andrea de Cesaris and a returning Lehto who had been replaced at\nBenetton after injury complications.\nThe Wendlinger accident was a pivotal moment in Formula One history. Together with the death of Ayrton\nSenna, it later prompted the mandatory implementation of head protection for drivers in the form of high\ncockpit sides. Sauber voluntarily pioneered prototypes of these to protect their drivers.\nThey would finish the season with the same points tally as the previous year but finished only eighth out of\nthe fourteen original entrants.

The 1995 season saw the return of Karl Wendlinger\npartnering Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Unfortunately, the Austrian's\nserious accident in 1994 seemed to have taken a lot out of his\ndriving potential and he was replaced after two races by rookie\nJean-Christophe  Boullion.\nThe season, for Frentzen at least, went surprisingly well. The team finished with a record eighteen points\ndespite the unde rperforming Ford engine and Jean-Christophe  Boullion, who was again droppe d, allowing\nWendlinger to make his final Formula One appearance. They also climbed back up to seventh in the\nConstructors' Championship.\n1995 also saw Petronas become Sauber's presenting sponsor.

Despite\nagain holding seventh spot on a shrinking list of constructors, they only scored 11 points and had not\nimpressed for much of the season. For the next season they announc ed a customer deal to receive Ferrari\nV10 engines while they worked with new spons ors Petronas to construct their own engines. Unfortunately,\ndue to a major econom ic crash in Asia the engines were never completed.\nSauber used Ferrari designed customer engines (from 1997 to 2005)\nand gearboxe s built by Sauber Petronas Engineering, a company\nfounde d for the sole purpose of building these engines, that were\nnearly identical to the ones used by Ferrari as Sauber was relegated\nto being a customer team after four years as an independent works\npartner team. Sauber licensed nearly every legally licensable part\nfrom Ferrari and even had several Ferrari engineers on staff.

His performances that year, however, more than vindicated their decision (he would\nlater go on to win the 2007 Drivers' Championship with Ferrari). It also caused Red Bull to sell their\nmajority share in the team to Credit Suisse in protest (Red Bull wanted Enrique Bernoldi to take the seat but\nhe wound up at Arrows). In 2004, Sauber spent a large sum of money on a new wind tunne l at Hinwil, and\na high performance supercomputer (called Albert) to help refine the aerodyna mics of their cars. The state-\nof-the-art infrastructure Sauber has built up is one aspect that attracted BMW Motorsport to Sauber.\nIn its later years, Sauber's links with Ferrari became weaker. They sided with the non-Ferrari teams over\nplanned rule changes at the end of the 2004 season and also joined up with the GPWC. Then they decided\nto switch to Michelin tyres, while Ferrari continued to use Bridgestone tyres. Meanwhile, beverage\ncompany Red Bull left Sauber in 2005 as they bought  their own team, Red Bull Racing. Sauber had\nsecured a deal with BMW for a supply of their engines from 2006, initially expected to be on a customer\nrelationship but following BMW's decision to split from Williams at the end of 2005, BMW agreed to take\nownership of the team from 1 January 2006, ha ving bought  Credit Suisse's shares in the team. Sauber's final\nGrand Prix before BMW takeover was the 2005 Chinese Grand Prix, with Massa, in his final race for the\nteam having been promoted to Ferrari for the 2006 season, scoring a welcome sixth place to round off the\nteam's history. Sauber had finished its independent run in F1 with six third places and two front-row starts\nbeing their best results. Among notable Sauber drivers were Jean Alesi, 2008 Drivers' Championship\nrunne r-up Felipe Massa, Johnny Herbert, and 1997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve.

BMW sold its part back to Peter Sauber after the end of the\n2009  season, but the team formally used the name BMW Saube r\nuntil the end of the 2010  season. The team held a German licence\nfrom 2006  to 2009 , then reverted to a Swiss licence in 2010 .[15]\nFor the 2006  season the team re-signed Nick Heidfeld from\nWilliams to be their lead driver (Heidfeld drove for Sauber in 2001\u2013\n2003) , while 1997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve had his\nexisting Sauber contract confirmed.
