He won the GP3\nSeries championship in 2016  and the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017 .\nLeclerc made his Formula One debut in 2018  for Sauber, a team affiliated with Ferrari, for which he\nwas part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. With Sauber having finished last the year before, Leclerc led\nthe charge to improve its finishing position in the Constructors' Championship to eighth, and was the\nhigher ranked of the two Sauber drivers. He joined Ferrari the next season and became the second-\nyounge st driver to qualify on pole position in Formula One at the 2019 Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2019\nseason also saw Leclerc take his first career win in Belgium. Leclerc finished runne r-up to Max\nVerstappen in the 2022 World Drivers' Championship. In 2024, Leclerc won the Monaco Grand Prix,\nbecoming the first Mon\u00e9gasque driver to win the race in 93 ye ars.\nAs of the 2024 Belgian Grand Prix, Leclerc has achieved 6 race wins, 25 pole positions, 9 fastest laps\nand 36 podiums in Formula One. He scored the first grand slam of his career at the 2022 Australian\nGrand Prix. Leclerc is set to remain at Ferrari until at least the end of  the 2026 s eason.[3]\nBorn to father Herv\u00e9 Leclerc and mother Pascale Leclerc,[4] Leclerc grew up as the middle child\nbetween older brother Lorenzo and younge r brother Arthur. His father also raced cars, driving in\nFormula 3 in the 1980s  and 1990s. Herv\u00e9 died after a long illness, aged 54, just four days before\nLeclerc would go on to win the feature race at the 2017 Baku Formula 2 round .[5][6] Two days before\nhis death, Leclerc lied to his father that he had signed a Formula One contract for the 2018  season; he\nsigned with Sauber a month later.[7] Leclerc's older brother Lorenzo was best friends with the late\nJules Bianchi, who became Leclerc's godfather until Bianchi's death in 2014. Leclerc's younge r\nbrother Arthur is also a racing driver in the European Le Mans Series, having raced in the FIA\nFormula 2 Championship the year before.\nLeclerc is trilingua l, fluent in French, Italian, and English.[8] Although the French pronunc iation of his\nname uses silent final consonants, he has stated that when speaking English he often uses the\nAnglicised pronunc iation.

In the six races he contested he finished on the podium three\ntimes, taking a second pl ace at the N\u00fcrburgring followed by a  pair of second-place finishes at the Hunga roring.[22]\nLeclerc graduated to Formula Three in 2015, racing in the FIA Formula 3 European Championship with Dutch team Van\nAmersfoort Racing.[23] At the opening round of the season in Silverstone, Leclerc inherited pole position for the second\nand third races of the weekend after original pole-sitter Felix Rosenqvist was excluded for a technical infringement.[24] He\nwent on to take his first race victory in the third race of the weekend, ahead of Antonio Giovinazzi and Jake Dennis.[25] He\ntook his second victory at the following round in Hockenheim, winning the third race as well as taking two additional\npodiums and three rookie victories over the course of the event.[26] Leclerc scored his third win in the first race at Spa-\nFrancorchamps which saw him take the lead in the championship. However, Leclerc finished fourth in the standings,\nmostly due  to damage sustained to his car's chassis following a collision w ith Lance Stroll at Zandvoor t.\nIn November 2015, L eclerc finished second a t the Macau Grand Prix.[27]\nIn December 2015, Leclerc partook in post-season testing with ART Grand Prix and Arden International. In February\n2016, de Vries confirmed that Leclerc would race in the 2016 GP3 season.[28] ART signed Leclerc the following week. With the team, he claimed three victories\nand took t he title in his first year of the series, despite crashing out  in the feature race of the season's final race in Abu D habi.[29]\nThe week following his victory in the GP3 title race, Charles Leclerc was confirmed to be graduating to the Formula 2\nseries for the 2017 s eason with Prema Racing, alongs ide fellow GP3 racer and Ferrari junior Antonio Fuoco.[30]\nHe made his debut at Bahrain, where he took pole position for the feature race, but only finished third.[31] In the sprint\nrace, his Prema team chose to take a mid-race pit stop, which is very uncommon in the shorter sprint races. He pushed\nharder on his medium Pirelli tyres, creating a nine-second lead before pitting. This would drop him down to 14th place, but\nLeclerc overtook 13 cars and took victory by overtaking Luca Ghiotto on the final lap.[32] After taking pole position for the\nsecond t ime in a row, he then fought  off Ghiotto to win again in the Catalunya  feature race, despite a radio issue.[33][34]\nLeclerc did not score any points at his home round at Monaco. He was on pole but retired from the lead of the race with a\nsuspension problem. The retirement also meant he would start the sprint race from the back of the grid, and in this race, he\ncollided with Norman Nato whilst trying to make his way up the grid, which ultimately resulted in both drivers retiring\nfrom the race. He retained the championship lead despite the bad weekend, w hich he described as 'huge ly disappointing'.[35][36][37]\nLeclerc took a fourth consecutive pole in Azerbaijan, which he dedicated to his late father, Herv\u00e9.[6] He conve rted this into another win, although the race was red-\nflagged five laps before the scheduled end.[38] In the sprint race, he started from eighth, and droppe d to tenth early on, but fought  back to sixth.

He won the feature race, even after his car set alight during the race, and even after one of his wing m irrors detached in the closing stages.[43]\nHe would not start from pole in Hunga ry, despite taking his seventh successive pole position, as he was disqualified for a technical infringement. Despite starting\nfrom the back, he was in 12th position by turn 1. Using an alternative tyre strategy that saw him start on the medium tyres, Leclerc was stuck behind Alexander\nAlbon, who was on the same strategy, although  he eventually got past and would finish fourth. He would also finish fourth in the sprint race the next day, giving\nhim a 50-point championship lead ove r Rowland.[44][45][46]\nFor the Belgian rounds, Leclerc again took pole and won the race by a convincing margin of over 20 seconds, however, his win was disqualified as one of his skid\nblocks was excessively worn. Having to start in 19t h place, Leclerc got back up t o fifth place and finished 3.8 s econds behind race winner S\u00e9rgio Sette C\u00e2mara.\nFor the Italian feature race, Leclerc was battling for the lead; on the final lap, however, he was involved in an accident with\nDe Vries. After starting towards the back of the grid for the second consecutive sprint race, Leclerc managed to fight his\nway back to ninth pos ition, a lbeit out of the points.\nWith a 57-point margin over Rowland heading into the penultimate rounds  at Jerez, Leclerc gained his eighth pole position\nof the season, with both of his timed laps being good enough for pole position. In the feature race, Leclerc dominated most\nof the early stint on soft tyres and was able to overtake most of the runne rs on the alternate strategy. With seven laps to go,\nhowever, Nobuha ru Matsushita collided with Santino Ferrucci, which brought  out the safety car.

He\nstarted eighth after penalties for the two Alfa Romeos and finished the race fifth with an extra point for the fastest lap of the race.[68] At the following race in\nMonaco, he was eliminated in Q1 and started 15th due to Ferrari's erroneous strategy that kept him in the garage to save tyres, unde restimating track evolution at\nthe end of  the qualifying session.
