Then, on lap 53, 4 laps from the end, disaster struck as both H\u00fclkenberg and Ricciardo,\nrunning 6th and 10th respectively, both retired with engine issues at the same corner.[64] Abiteboul stated that Renault's\nengine problems were \"unacceptable\".[65] These issues were compounde d, when H\u00fclkenberg again retired from a points-\nscoring position with engine issues at the next race in China, this time with a software issue.[66] In Spain, H\u00fclkenberg\ncrashed in qualifying and damaged his front wing. He had to fit a different specification front wing, which broke parc\nferm\u00e9 rules, ensuring he would have to start the race in the pit lane. He would finish the race in 13th.[67] In the following\nrace in Monaco, a chance of a points finish evaporated, when the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc hit H\u00fclkenberg, while\nattempting an overtaking move, which the German labelled \"too ambitious\". Both drivers suffered punc tures. H\u00fclkenberg\nrecovered to 13th, but Leclerc eventually retired from the race.[68] He then finished the next two races in 7th and 8th place\nin Canada and France respectively. At the British Grand Prix, he recovered to a 10th-place finish, after he was hit by former\nteammate Sergio P\u00e9rez and his engine momentarily failing and going into 'limp mode', whilst also bemoaning the team's\nstrategy.[69] H\u00fclkenberg then crashed out of his home race in precarious wet conditions. He was in 4th place, having run as high as 2nd at one point, when he\ncrashed out  at Turn 16, w here fellow drivers Charles Leclerc, race leader Lewis Hamilton and former teammate Carlos Sainz also went off. The latter two managed\nto survive their incidents and continue, while both Leclerc and H\u00fclkenberg retired. Both retirees criticised the run-off of the corner, which is a different tarmac used\nfor dragster racing, which meant there was no grip in the wet conditions to help prevent the accident.[70] At the following race in Hunga ry, H\u00fclkenberg was in the\nrunning for points, but then he suffered yet another engine problem on his Renault, which meant he was only able to finish in 12th place.[71] Going into the\nsummer break, H\u00fclkenberg was only 14th in the championship with 17 points, 5 points behind new teammate Daniel Ricciardo in 11th place. Renault's points total\nof 39 poi nts was 43 poi nts behind the position they were in the previous year, after they suffered a disappointing first half of the season.\nJust before the Belgian GP it was announc ed by Renault that H\u00fclkenberg would be replaced by Mercedes reserve driver and former Force India driver Esteban\nOcon for the 2020 season.[72] H\u00fclkenberg said the decision was \"not only about performance\", alluding that the French Renault team desired a French driver in\nOcon.[73] Four-time World Champion Alain Prost, non-executive director for Renault Sport at the time, said that Renault offered H\u00fclkenberg a new one-year\ncontract with an opt ion for another year, but the German refused the offer due to wanting a full two-year contract.[74]\nH\u00fclkenberg started the second half of the season strongly by qualifying 7th in Belgium. A grid penalty meant he started 12th, and he fell even further back when he\ntook evasive action to avoid collisions involving Verstappen, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n, Ricciardo and Stroll. However, he executed an alternate two-stop strategy and made up 3\nplaces in the last lap to finish 8th.[75] In Italy, both Renaults had a very strong weekend, with Ricciardo and H\u00fclkenberg qualifying 5th and 6th respectively, with\nboth drivers moving up a place to finish 4th and 5th, after Sebastian Vettel spun out of contention.

He was restricted to only 15th in qualifying, after a mechanical failure in Q2 meant he could not set a representative time to progress further.\nHowever, in the race he made a fantastic start and was up to 10th place by the end of the first lap and he would end up finishing the race in that position.[79]\nHowever, following a protest by rival constructor Racing Point, both Renault cars were disqualified for having a pre-set automated brake bias system that was\ndeemed to be a driver aid, and thus illegal.[80] This was H\u00fclkenberg's first disqualification in his entire F1 career.\nHe then managed to salvage a point at the following race with 10th after he was spun into the wall by Daniil Kvyat at the last corner of the last lap, when running\nin 9th.

He was penalised for overtaking Kevin Magnussen before the safety car line during the safety car restart, and thus was classified 15th, his worst result of\nthe year.[83] He was voted Driver of the Day in the season finale in Abu Dhabi, taking the title for the first time, after finishing 12th in what was his possible final\nrace in Formula One, having failed to secure a drive for the 2020 s eason.[84][85]\nHe finished the season in 14th place, his lowest placing in the standings in the sport since his debut season in 2010, having scored 37 points across the season, 17\nless than teammate Daniel Ricciardo.[86]\nH\u00fclkenberg did not have a contract for the 2020 F1 season.
