It returned\nto the Formula One calendar in 2014 , where it has remained since then. It was first held at the Zeltweg Air\nBase for its first, non-Championship running. Since 1970, the race has been held at the \u00d6sterreichring,\ncurrently know n as the Red Bull Ring due to its ownership by the Austrian drinks company of the same\nname. Ever since it returned to the calendar, the Austrian Grand Prix is typically held during the mid-season\nrounds  of the Formula One World Championship, with one exception: the Austrian Grand Prix was held as\nthe season opener in 2020 , due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdow ns\ndisrupting the season. Also in 2020, an additional race, held also at the Red Bull Ring, was added to the\ncalendar called the Styrian Grand Prix, which was held twice, facilitating a double-header to maximise the\nnumber of Grands Prix dur ing seasons that were affected by t he pandemic.\nThe Austrian Grand Prix has been held at two different locations in southeastern Austria, being originally\nheld in Zeltweg, about 70 km (43 mi) west of Graz. Since 1969 the Austrian Grand Prix has taken place in\nneighbour ing Spielberg, with the two venues being within approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) of each other.[1] It\nwas first held at the Zeltweg Air Base for six years, before a permanent track, originally called the\n\u00d6sterreichring and later know n as the A-1 ring and R ed Bull Ring, w as built.\nA non-championship event was held in 1963 at a race track on the Zeltweg Airfield and it was won by\nAustralian Jack Brabham. The first championship event took place in the following year, and Italian\nLorenzo Bandini won his only Formula One championship race in a Ferrari. The race was a success, but\nthe track was deemed too dangerous; it was narrow and very bumpy, and spectators complained of poor\nviewing areas. The FIA removed the race from the F1 calendar until a suitable track was built.\nThe event was run in 1965 as a non-championship sports car race, the Zeltweg 200 Miles, before being\nadopted by t he World Sportscar Championship from 1966 t o 1969 a s the 1000 km  Zeltweg.[2]History\nZeltweg Airfield circuit\n\u00d6sterreichring", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2419, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "089e3070-d35e-4306-a71e-4889a40ecd15": {"__data__": {"id_": "089e3070-d35e-4306-a71e-4889a40ecd15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Austrian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7af54017-c5a4-41c3-a4ba-06d3078d4b22", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Austrian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "ee800e53db9b80e8985b249a12b9c5ee8916feed19eb8737134c63970afc500d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d49df11e-a33d-4993-b9dc-775ea7e9d1e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea42ec673d3465379ebf774ab09342a659d23ae7ea436ca968425bc93605546b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "From 1970 until 1987, the event was held at the \u00d6sterreichring (translated literally as \"Austria circuit\", also\nlocated near Zeltweg). It was built in the scenic Styrian mountains and it was a fast, flowing track where\nevery corner was high speed and long. The Austrian Grand Prix was designated the European Grand Prix\nonce, 1975, when this title was an honor ary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe.\nThe very fast track was popul ar with drivers, and the events were moderately successful. The first race on\nthis track was dominated by Ferrari, with their more powerful Flat-12 engines enabled them to be 10 mph\nfaster \u2013 which is a lot in racing terms. The 1971 race saw Swiss driver Jo Siffert dominate in his BRM and\nBriton Jackie Stewart took his second Drivers' Championship. The 1975 event was marred by the fatal\naccident of American Mark Donohue , and the race itself was rain-soaked and was won by Vittorio\nBrambilla, winning the only F1 race of his career, and, true to form, he crashed into the guardrail and broke\nthe nose of his car shortly after crossing the finish line when the race was stoppe d early because the rain got\nworse (although the race started after 1 hour and 15 minutes of delay, due the heavy rain, with the drivers\ndoing extra practice during this time). In 1976, home favourite Niki Lauda's appalling crash at the\nN\u00fcrburgring caused him to miss the race, which was won by Briton John Watson in the short-lived Penske\nF1 team, winning hi s first Formula One race (and Penske's only win in the category).\n1976 had seen the Voest-Hugel corner changed slightly into one corner instead of two corners; but 1977\nsaw a slow three-corner chicane installed at Voest-Hugel, which was where Donohue  had crashed two\nyears before. What was the fastest corner on the track was now the slowest corner there and would become\nknow n as the Hella-Licht Chicane. This race was won by Australian Alan Jones in a Shadow; and like with\nBrambilla and Watson, it was his first Grand Prix victory. 1978 saw the dominant Lotus 79s on the front\nrow, and American Mario Andretti crashed at the Glatz Kurve on the first lap, and his teammate, Swede\nRonnie Peterson took victory. 1979 started to show the superiority of turbo-charged engines on this fast and\nhigh-altitude circuit. Although Jones won again in a Williams, Jean-Pierre Jabouille and Rene Arnoux in\ntheir Renaults were able to dominate this event and also the following year's race, which Jabouille won.\n1981 saw three turbo-charged cars dominate the front row; and into the race, the immense power and\ndreadful handling of Didier Pironi's Ferrari helped him to hold up four better handling cars and get into a\nfive-way battle for third place, which went on for a while but the four cars eventually passed him, one of\nwhich was Jacques Laffite who went on to win the race. 1982 saw a spectacular show in which five\nturbocharged cars dominated the grid; all but one of these cars retired with mechanical problems, including\nItalian Riccardo Patrese who had a spectacular accident at the Texaco Bends, and Frenchman Alain Prost\nwhose engine expired with a few laps to go while in the lead. After Prost's retirement, the race turned into a\ndead-heat sprint between Italian Elio de Angelis in a Lotus and Finn Keke Rosberg in a Williams. In the\nbeginning, R osberg had been steadily chipping away at de Angelis; but after Prost retired, Rosberg began to\nmake up 1.5 seconds a lap on de Angelis; and on the last lap the two so-far winless drivers battled for\nvictory, and de Angelis was able to hold off Rosberg and win by less than half a car's length; 0.05 seconds.\n1984 saw Lauda finally take victory at home Grand Prix in his McLaren, and Prost won the next two races.\nThe 1985 race saw a fearsome crash at the Panorama Curve when Andrea de Cesaris spectacularly rolled\nhis Ligier, which led to him being fired from the team.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3918, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d49df11e-a33d-4993-b9dc-775ea7e9d1e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d49df11e-a33d-4993-b9dc-775ea7e9d1e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Austrian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7af54017-c5a4-41c3-a4ba-06d3078d4b22", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Austrian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "ee800e53db9b80e8985b249a12b9c5ee8916feed19eb8737134c63970afc500d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "089e3070-d35e-4306-a71e-4889a40ecd15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Austrian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "de0a61f0f5f6cd4aaafcc80691df3ee2793c4c4145431d45a3a6c5d46c249a4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "After Prost's retirement, the race turned into a\ndead-heat sprint between Italian Elio de Angelis in a Lotus and Finn Keke Rosberg in a Williams.
