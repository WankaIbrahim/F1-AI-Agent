He set a quickest time of 1:42.651. Previously he had done  work in the team's driving simulator.[12] Magnussen's\ntime was the best of the three-day test impressing McLaren's sporting director Sam Michael. The distance he covered in the\ncourse of the test was sufficient to earn his FIA Super Licence.[13]\nMagnussen would drive for McLaren for the 2014  season, replacing Sergio P\u00e9rez.[2] In line with a new rule introduc ed for\nthe 2014 season requiring drivers to choose a car number to use during their Formula One career, Magnus sen raced with\nnumber 20 as this was the number he had on his DAMS car in 2013 when he won the Formula Renault 3.5\nchampionship.[14]\nAt the Jerez and Bahrain pre-season tests he toppe d the timesheets, and at the first race in Australia, he qualified in fourth\nposition.[15] In the race itself, Magnussen avoided crashing at the start after his car encountered oversteer through\nwheelspin.[16] After passing Lewis Hamilton's ailing Mercedes in the early stages, Magnussen maintained position to take\na third-place finish; he finished 2.2 seconds behind Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo.[17] As a result, Magnus sen became the\nsecond Danish driver \u2013 after his father Jan, who was sixth at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix \u2013 to take a points-scoring\nfinish, the first Danish podium finisher and the first debutant, since Hamilton at the 2007 Australian Grand Prix, to take a\npodium in his first Grand Prix.[18][19] After the race, Magnussen described the result as \"like a victory\".[20] He was later\npromoted to second place in the results, after Ricciardo was disqualified due to fuel irregularities,[21] making him the first\nrookie to finish second since Jacques Villeneuve at the 1996 Australian Grand Prix.[22] Magnussen recorded eleven furtherEarly career\nFormula One career\nMcLaren (2014\u20132015)\n2014", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2969, "end_char_idx": 5267, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c87f6bfb-c7b1-4c60-a993-0de97f9c9c04": {"__data__": {"id_": "c87f6bfb-c7b1-4c60-a993-0de97f9c9c04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "kevin_magnussen.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7520e21e-84aa-4d8a-ade7-71c5e35c24bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "kevin_magnussen.pdf"}, "hash": "8f0aa075fff05dc8633298e1ceebe09fb84aed94c68d7caad4f7abfcc95dccc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e046e1bd-d274-4a50-850e-9b6bac137dba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb75045732ab04b9aa1a2ff425347c9b2d3fb20976c2178c3bd31bf423ff0e28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "nussen.com/)\nPrevious series\n2012\u20132013\n2011\n2010\n2009\n2009\n2008\n2008Formula Renault\n3.5 Series\nBritish Formula 3\nGerman Formula\nThree\nFormula Renault\n2.0 NEC\nEurocup Formula\nRenault 2.0\nDanish Formula\nFord\nADAC Formel\nMasters\nChampionship titles\n2013\n2008Formula Renault\n3.5 Series\nDanish Formula\nFord\nMagnussen in 2012\nMagnussen at the 2014 British Grand\nPrix\nMagnussen at the 2016 Malaysian\nGrand Prix\nMagnussen driving for Haas at the\n2017 Malaysian Grand Prix.points-scoring finishes throughout  2014, the majority being ninth- or tenth-place finishes; although he recorded seventh-\nplace finishes in Austria and Great Britain \u2013 circuits where he had prior experience from junior formulae \u2013 and a fifth-place\nfinish in Russia.\nFernando Alonso replaced Magnussen for the 2015 season and Magnussen became the test and reserve driver for\nMcLaren.[23] Magnussen had talks with Honda -powered team Andretti Autosport to compete in the 2015 IndyCar Series,\nbut McLaren blocked the deal.[24] Magnussen competed in one race, the Australian Grand Prix after doctors advised\nAlonso to not race due to a concussion sustained during an accident during pre-season testing.[25][26] However,\nMagnussen failed to start the race after suffering an engine failure on the formation lap.[27] Magnussen was released from\nMcLaren at the end of  the year.[28]\nAfter being released by McLaren, Magnussen was confirmed to have been in discussion to drive for the Haas F1 Team,\nbefore Romain Grosjean and Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez were named as the team's drivers.[29] Magnussen had reportedly also been\nin talks about a seat at Manor Racing.[30][31] Magnussen tested a Mercedes DTM car,[32] and Porsche's LMP1 car,[33]\nhinting that he may have had options outside Formula One, including IndyC ar, where he was believed to have entered\ntalks with Bryan Herta Autosport about a drive.[34]\nIn early 2016 unconfirmed reports emerged that Magnussen was set to replace Pastor Maldona do at Renault following a\nbreach of contract between Maldona do and the team.

At the opening race in Australia, Magnussen lined up 5th on\nthe grid, Haas's highest ever starting position.[46] He had run as high as 4th, however both Haas cars would retire from the\nrace after their wheels were fitted incorrectly during their pit stops.

In Britain,\nMagnussen and teammate Grosjean made contact on the first lap, causing race-ending damage for both drivers. Both were\nblamed and criticised for the incident, at a race in which Grosjean was testing the old spec of the VF-19 so that the team could unde rstand their recent lack of\npace.[55]\nMagnussen next scored points at the rain-affected German Grand Prix, finishing 10th before being promoted to 8th after the Alfa Romeo drivers were penalised\npost-race for the use of driver aids.

He later turned that into a ninth-place finish, securing Haas consecutive points for the first time since 2019.[61][62]\nMagnussen finished 10th at Silverstone with his teammate Mick Schumacher finishing eighth giving Haas a first doubl e-\npoint finish since Germany 2019,[63] and the pair would continue this run by scoring points again in the following round in\nAustria, despite the Dane experiencing engine issues during the race.[64] At the 2022 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix, Magnussen\ntook his and Haas\u2019 first pole position in Formula One. Magnussen qualified first after George Russell spun at turn 4, bringing out a red flag during which track\nconditions deteriorated meaning no driver could set a faster time than before the crash.[65] Magnussen became just the second driver in F1 history to set a pole for a\nnon-Ferrari team using a Ferrari engine, 14 years after Sebastian Vettel did so for Toro Rosso at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix.
