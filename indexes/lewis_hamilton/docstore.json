Hamilton MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985)  is a British racing driver competing in\nFormula One, driving for Mercedes. Hamilton has won a joint-record seven Formula One World Drivers' Championship\ntitles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for most wins (105), pole positions (104), and podium finishes\n(201), among others.\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to\na Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007  to 2012 , making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his debut\nseason, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runne r-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n by one point. The following season,\nhe won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\u2014m aking a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season\u2014to\nbecome the then-younge st ever Formula One World Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with\nMercedes in 2013 .\nChanges to the regulations for 2014  mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period\nfor Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014  and 2015  during an intense\nrivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016 , Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became\nHamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim\nconsecutive titles again in 2017  and 2018 . His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019  and 2020  to equal\nSchumacher's record of seven drivers' titles. Hamilton surpassed 100 race wins and pole positions in 2021 . He will join\nFerrari for the 2025  season.\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the\nsport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has\nalso become a prominent advoc ate in suppor t of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport.\nHamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the\n2021 N ew Year Honour s.\nLewis Carl Davidson Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage,\nHertfordshire.[2] His father, Anthony  Hamilton, is of Grenadian descent, while his mother,\nCarmen Larbalestier, is British, from Birmingha m,[7] making him mixed-race;[8][9]\nHamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and\nolder half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.[10] Hamilton then lived with\nhis father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing\ndriver.[11][12] Hamilton w as raised a Catholic.[13]\nHamilton's father bought  him a radio-controlled car when he was five.[14] Hamilton\nfinished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult\ncompetition.[15] Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to\nracist abuse.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3881, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b81cd4b8-daac-4eb0-9f0e-968c353d24f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b81cd4b8-daac-4eb0-9f0e-968c353d24f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "lewis_hamilton.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2233465-7ebe-49ef-949a-5196eacd8811", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "lewis_hamilton.pdf"}, "hash": "8e4f7f121ad27f7e0ab34bd843fb9b240520fbc441d26af8f03bb2ed269aaa54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "78bafaac-7ed3-4366-829e-8fcd219b1fe0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "lewis_hamilton.pdf"}, "hash": "39caa67556a24623bcb278fa6da620196d4ed9a247a1ce7e34b2351fe3b946f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[2] His father, Anthony  Hamilton, is of Grenadian descent, while his mother,\nCarmen Larbalestier, is British, from Birmingha m,[7] making him mixed-race;[8][9]\nHamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and\nolder half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.[10] Hamilton then lived with\nhis father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing\ndriver.[11][12] Hamilton w as raised a Catholic.[13]\nHamilton's father bought  him a radio-controlled car when he was five.[14] Hamilton\nfinished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult\ncompetition.[15] Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to\nracist abuse.[14][16] Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six\nand promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school.[17] To\nsuppor t his son, Hamilton's father took redunda ncy from his position as an IT manager and\nbecame a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as\na doubl e glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents,[18] while\nstill attending his son's races.[19] Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company.[20] He\ncontinued to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010.[21][22]\nHamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic seconda ry school in\nStevenage.[23] Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at\nschool.[24] He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow\nstudent who was treated in hospital for his injuries.[25] In addition to racing, he played association football for his school\nteam with eventual England international, Ashley Young .[20] Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not\nworked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams.[26] In February\n2001, he  began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.[27]\nHamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships.[28][29] Two years later,\nhe became the younge st driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten.

In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for\nTeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula\nOne; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016.

Although the two saw little of each other on the\ntrack, Schumacher praised the young B riton.[34]\nHamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.[15]\nThis led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished fifth overall.[35] He\nremained with Manor for another year, winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.[36] Having clinched the\nchampionship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British\nFormula 3 Championship.[37] In his first race he was forced out with a punc ture,[38] and in the second he crashed out and\nwas taken to hos pital after a collision w ith teammate Tor Graves.[39]\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the younge st ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his\ngoal was \"not to be the younge st in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula\nOne\".[40] He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship.[41]\nHe also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix,[42] and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.[43][44] Williams had come close\nto signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[45] Hamilton\neventually re-signed with McLaren.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3786, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b42c9a0-e7d0-44fb-8fc0-2deb0aced729": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b42c9a0-e7d0-44fb-8fc0-2deb0aced729", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "lewis_hamilton.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ee53300-9de7-48cd-b41d-86f396b7c494", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "lewis_hamilton.pdf"}, "hash": "2034bb57f37b3cf3456e73f5ea3610435e0d278ab81afa429a94c4871f9db935", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9601346a-7014-4f31-a5b4-428812f1e868", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "lewis_hamilton.pdf"}, "hash": "7bdf0c4e3919a836ca5ab0f37f8de7ed0eedf6db1f3c0b9a5eebb3d8fe42b53d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[39]\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the younge st ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his\ngoal was \"not to be the younge st in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula\nOne\".[40] He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship.[41]\nHe also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix,[42] and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.[43][44] Williams had come close\nto signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[45] Hamilton\neventually re-signed with McLaren.

In 2011, it was the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson\nButton finished runne r-up to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in his private life\nand run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he\nwould return to form for 2012.[71] In the 2012  season, Hamilton finished fourth in the standings and achieved\nfour race wins, despite several operational failures and reliability issues.[72][73][74] Before the end of the year,\nHamilton announc ed, to much surprise, that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013  season, replacing the\nretiring M ichael Schumacher.[75]\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The\nmove was met with surprise by pundi ts and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent\nhistory of success, as a gamble.[76][77] In his first season with the Brackley-based team, Hamilton secured a sole race\nvictory, winning the Hunga rian Grand Prix, where he conve rted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over\n11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n.[78] With a number of other podium finishes and pole positions,\nHamilton finished fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.[75]\nChanges to engine regulations for the 2014  season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start\nof a highly successful era for Hamilton.

The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges both\non and off the track,[85] culminating in Hamilton defying team orders at the final Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and deliberately\nslowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to\novertake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win the title.[86] Ultimately, a succession of poor starts from\nHamilton early in the season and a crucial engine blowout at the Malaysian Grand Prix meant Rosberg took the title,[85]\nwhich he successfully secured before announc ing his shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his\nrival.[75][87]\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the\nchampionship lead throughout  2017  in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions,\nand his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race\nvictories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico\nwith two races to spare.[75]Mercedes (2013\u20132024)\n2013\u20132016: Teammates with Rosberg\n2017\u20132020: Four titles in a row", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3220, "end_char_idx": 7117, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1f9f648-a53c-43a7-9dc8-b585bd5f53a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1f9f648-a53c-43a7-9dc8-b585bd5f53a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "lewis_hamilton.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6cce1000-e24e-4fc6-b442-a3bb6bdd0d48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "lewis_hamilton.pdf"}, "hash": "3a101716beb891156118e8a35e587c8b1cc235e7387ce31a6c93c18f11788b4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "35b080e5-a75c-4f1a-b7ff-3bae795a1c39", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58b354af963aac4ff2ad9b300339ef6fae62bbcf89eea7400ddd7310b3a0fbf1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The 2018 season was the first time\nin the sport that two four-time World\nChampions (Hamilton and Vettel)\ncompeted for a fifth title.\nHamilton (left) and Verstappen\nengaged in several on-track battles\nthroughout the 2021 season.\nPictured is the 2021 United States\nGrand Prix.\nHamilton's intense battle with\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc for the final\nspot on the podium, at the 2022\nBritish Grand Prix.The 2018  season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a\nfifth title and was billed as the \"Fight for Five\" by journalists and fans.[88][89][90] As with the 2017 season, Ferrari and\nVettel appeared to have the uppe r hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point; however,\nVettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the\nlatter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title at the Mexican Grand Prix for a second year running as he set a new\nrecord for the most points scored in a season (408).[75][87] During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with\nMercedes, reported to be worth up t o \u00a340 m illion pe r year, making hi m the best-paid Formula One driver in history.[91]\nHaving signed a contract with Mercedes that lasted until 2020, it was confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in\n2019 .[92] Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate\nBottas, the Honda -powered Red Bull of Max Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Charles Leclerc, to clinch his\nsixth drivers' crown at the United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.[93][94] After scoring his sixth career grand\nslam at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins (matching his\nprevious best in 2014 and 2018)  and 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole\npositions.[95] His total of 413 poi nts for the season w as a new all-time record, seeing the Briton finish 87 poi nts clear of second-placed Bottas.[96]\nHamilton won his seventh drivers' title in 2020 , equalling the record set by Schumacher, in a season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[97][98] Over\nthe shortened seventeen-race season, Hamilton took 11 wins (equalling his previous personal best, but in fewer races) including one in Portugal to break\nSchumacher's record of 91 wins.[99] He also took 14 podiums and 10 pole positions.

Russell also signed a two-year extension, retaining Mercedes' driver pair.[126][127] Although Hamilton finished second at the United States Grand Prix, he\nwas stripped of the podium due to a post-race disqualification, caused by a technical infringement. It was recognized as a crucial turnaround in his fight for the\nsecond position in the Driver's Championship with Red Bull's Sergio P\u00e9rez.[128] Outdriving the capabilities of the W14 throughout  the season, Hamilton finished\nat an impressive third in the Driver's Championship, while teammate Russell finished eighth to secure second position for Mercedes in the Constructor's\nChampionship, three points ahead of Ferrari.

He just doesn't fade, mentally or\nphysically.\"[150]\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in\nthose conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest\nmargin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[151][152] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained\nunbe aten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix,\nwhere his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[153] His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand\nPrix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest\nperformances\".[102] Despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track\nthat lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions\nwhilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds.\nHis performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th\nplace.[154][155][156] Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.[157]\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him]\nwhen I was young and I thought  'this is how I want to drive when I get the oppor tunity' and I went out there and tried it on\nthe kart track.

In\nlater years a white ring was added and the ribbons  were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[206]\nHamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to\nchange to a mostly white approach.[207] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[208] The winning\ndesign used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of Hamilton's\nthree Formula One championships at that time, on either side.[209] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more\nstars to his helmet on w inning further World Championship titles.[210]\nHamilton has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout  his career.\nAt the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, he sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top.[211] At\nthe 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton brought  with him a striking blue-and-green design in honour  of team sponsor Petronas\nbut was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[212] Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career.\nAfter winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of\nthe helmet with the words World Champion.[213] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his\nfifth world title, towards which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[210] and did so again at the 2019 Abu\nDhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following hi s sixth World Championship title.[214]\nHamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix,\nhe wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Founda tion.[215]\nAt the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda,\nwho died at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back. After the race, Hamilton\nreflected on Lauda's career, saying: \"Ultimately, as a driver, my goal one day is to hope fully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely someone who led by a\ngreat example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\"[216] Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019\nBrazilian Grand Prix.[217]\nHamilton switched into a different design in 2020, which used black as base colour with purple details, in suppor t of Black Lives Matter, he also continued to use\nthe same design in 2021.[218] Hamilton wore a rainbow  helmet at the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in\nsuppor t of the LGBTQ+ community.[219] Ahead of the 2022 season, Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, it also used\npurple details.[220] He also used one-off designs for the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.[221][222][223]\nEvolutions of the yellow helmet design were used in 2023 and 2024.[224] He wore special designs for the 2023 Japanese Grand Prix and 2023 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand\nPrix.[225][226]\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso.

Hamilton said he thought  the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[230] Hamilton was\nreported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[231] British motorsport journal Autosport claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his\nheadphone s on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\";[232] however, McLaren later issued a statement\non be half of Hamilton that denied the use of any pr ofanity.[233]\nAs a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short\nperiod.[234][235] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008 .[236] The rivalry\nbetween the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[237][238][239] Alonso and McLaren terminated\ntheir contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[240] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair\ndissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[241] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car\nlike 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\"[191] Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest\ndrivers of all time.[63] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to\nAlonso by dr iving, e ach on one  side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donut s.[242]\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season.

Over\ntheir four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained\nand, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[244] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000,\nwhen they were in karting.[245] They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European\nchampion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were\ncompetitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a\ntime.\"[246] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings;[246] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but\nbrought  up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas\nHamilton was born on a counc il estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior\nracing.[20]\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability but with\nan intellect to match Rosberg's.[162] Buxton w rote:\nMan to man against Rosberg, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher. He has made his\ntires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hunga ry) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he hasn't\nused too much fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer\nmany pa int Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot .[162]\nTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was\nalways more analytical.[20] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the\nintellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management, and moderate fuel usage.[162] Hamilton's tyre management has frequently\nallowed him to push on for longe r, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone  on the grid. Sky Sport's\nMark Hughes, commented: \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodol ogy, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a\nbalance he can work with, then adapt his driving around i t.\"[142][247]\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes, and qualified\nahead of Rosberg 42 times, while Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes, and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two\nWorld Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[248]\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer\ntogether.[249] After three years of Mercedes's dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produc ed a car that was capable of\nfighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018.[250][251][252][253] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an\nearly lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought  back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons.

In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One suppor ters at the Chinese Grand Prix.[259] In\n2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya  by several Spanish\nspectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [sic]\".[260]\nThe FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour,[261] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\"\ncampaign.[262] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-\nbased advertising agency TBWA and named pinchalaruedade Hamilton, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's\ntyre\", was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and\nporcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial\ninsults.[263] In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix.\nMercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement conde mning the abuse and called for those responsible to be\nheld accountable.[264]\nHamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist.
