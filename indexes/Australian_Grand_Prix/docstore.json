The race became part of the\nFormula One World Championship in 1985 .\nSince 1996 , it has been held at the Albert\nPark Circuit in Melbourne, with the\nexceptions of 2020  and 2021, when the races\nwere cancelled due to the COVID-19\npandemic.[2] Before that, it was held in\nAdelaide.[3]\nWhile an event called the Australian Grand\nPrix was staged in 1927 at the grass surface\nGoulburn Racecourse held as a series of\nsprints,[4] it is generally accepted that the\nAustralian Grand Prix began as the 100 Miles\nRoad Race held at the Phillip Island road\ncircuit in 1928.[5] The inaugural race was\nwon by Arthur Waite in what was effectively\nan entry suppor ted by the Austin Motor\nCompany, a modified Austin 7. For eight\nyears, races, first called the Australian Grand\nPrix in 1929 , continued on the rectangular\ndirt road circuit. Bugattis dominated the results, taking four consecutive wins from 1929 to 1932. The last\nPhillip Island race was in 1935 and the title lapsed for three years. An AGP style event was held on Boxing\nDay, 1936  at the South Australian town of Victor Harbor for a centennial South Australian Grand Prix[6]\nbefore the Australian Grand Prix title was revived in 1938  for the grand opening of what would become\none of the world's most famous race tracks, Mount Panorama just outside the semi-rural town of Bathurst.\nOnly just completed, with a tar seal for the circuit still a year away, the race was won by Englishman PeterHistory\nPre-war", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2362, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4881d448-57af-4ab6-99d4-f82242b04480": {"__data__": {"id_": "4881d448-57af-4ab6-99d4-f82242b04480", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6bb4ec66-b025-49ba-9753-33d7f0aa5013", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "9e92dc3638d654f1d681d6f67ddff4a09a99c30c7f23e0ced95444095e94314a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Arthur Waite won the 1928 100 Miles\nRoad Race at the Phillip Island road\ncircuit driving an Austin 7Whitehead racing a new voiturette ERA B-Type that was just too\nfast for the locally developed machinery.[7] One more race was\nheld, at the Lobethal Circuit near the South Australian town of\nLobethal in 1939 , before the country was plunge d into World War\nII.\nIn the immediate post-war era, racing was sparse with competitors\nusing pre-war cars with supplies cobbled together around the rationing of fuel and tyres. Mount Panorama\nheld the first post-war Grand Prix in 1947 , beginning a rotational system between the Australian States,[8]\nas fostered by the Australian Automobile Association.[9] A mixture of stripped-down produc tion sports cars\nand Australian \"specials\" were to take victories as the race travelled amongst temporary conve rted airfield\ncircuits and street circuits like Point Cook, Leyburn, Nuriootpa and Narrogin before, on the races return to\nMount Panorama in 1952 , the way to the future was pointed by Doug Whiteford racing a newly imported\nTalbot-Lago Formula One car to victory. Grand Prix machinery had already been filtering through in the\nshape of older Maserati and OSCAs and smaller Coope rs but had yet to prove to be superior to the locally\ndeveloped cars. The end of the Australian \"specials\" was coming, but the magnificent Maybach-based\nseries of specials driven exube rantly by Stan Jones would give many hope  for the next few years.\nLex Davison, who for several years would experiment with sports car engines in smaller Formula 2 chassis,\ntook his first of four victories in a Jaguar engined Formula 2 HWM in 1954 , while the previous year\nWhiteford won his third and final Grand Prix as for the first time racing cars thundered around the streets\nsurroundi ng the Albert Park Lake in inner Melbourne. That circuit, which for four brief years gave Australia\nthe stronge st taste of the grandeur surroundi ng European Grand Prix racing, was 40 years later very much\nmodified, used to host the 1996 Australian Grand Prix as the modern Formula One world championship\nvenue. Jack Brabham took his first of three AGP wins in 1955  at the short Port Wakefield Circuit in South\nAustralia. The race is significant in that Brabham was driving a Bristol powered Coope r T40, the first ever\nrear-engine car to win the Grand Prix.\nThe Grand Prix returned to Albert Park in 1956 , Melbourne's Olympic Games year to play host to a group\nof visiting European teams, led by Stirling Moss and the factory Maserati racing team who brought  a fleet\nof 250F  Grand Prix cars and 300S  sports racing cars. Moss won the Grand Prix from Maserati teammate\nJean Behra. That 1956 r ace would inspire the next great era of the Grand Prix.[10]\nThe growing influence of engineer-drivers Jack Brabham and a couple of years behind him New Zealander\nBruce McLaren would transform the race. Brabham, who first won the Grand Prix in 1955  in a Coope r\nT40 Bristol he had brought  home from his first foray into English racing,[11] would test new developments\nfor Coope r during the European winter, beginning a flood of Coope r-Climax Grand Prix machinery into\nAustralia and New Zealand before Brabham started building his own cars, as well as the appearance of\nLotus chassis as well, finally killing off the Australian \"specials\".

The popul arity of the Tasman\nformulae was directly responsible for 1966' s \"return to power\" in Formula One, and having spent years\ndeveloping with Repco the Brabham cars and eventually the Oldsmobile-based Repco V8s in the Tasman\nseries gave Jack Brabham the oppor tunity to unexpectedly dominate Formula One in his Brabhams with a\nready-proven lightweight car that left Ferrari and the British \"garagistes\" struggling with their heavy,\ntechnically fragile or unde rpowered cars until the appearance of the Lotus-Cosworth in 1967.\nThe Formula One stars of the era all visited the Tasman Series, including W orld Champions Jim Clark, John\nSurtees, Phil Hill, Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill and Jochen Rindt, while other F1 regulars Timmy Mayer,\nPedro Rodriguez, Piers Courage, leading teams from Coope r, Lotus, Lola, BRM, even the four wheel drive\nFerguson P99 and finally, Ferrari, racing against the local stars, Jack Brabham, Bruce McLaren, Denny\nHulme, Chris Amon, Frank Gardner, Frank Matich, Leo Geoghe gan and Kevin Bartlett. Brabham won the\nGrand Prix three times, McLaren twice, Clark twice, the second was his last major victory before his\nuntimely death, winning a highly entertaining battle with Chris Amon at the 1968 Australian Grand Prix at\nSandow n Raceway.

Local\nTasman cars were declining as well and after originally opting a 2.0 litre version of Tasman to be the future\nof the Australian Grand Prix, the overwhelming suppor t for the already well established Formula 5000  saw\nnatural selection force CAMS' hand.[12]\nFor the first half of the 1970s , the Tasman Series continued as a local series primarily for Formula 5000\nracers, but by 1976, the Australian and New Zealand legs fractured apart and the Australian Grand Prix\nseparated from the remnants and became a stand-alone race once more. During this era, the former Tasman\nstars, Matich, Geoghe gan and B artlett would continue on a s a new generation of  drivers emerged, some like\nGarrie Coope r (Elfin) and Graham McRae developing their own cars while others like Max Stewart, John\nMcCormack and Alfredo Costanzo using European-built cars, mostly Lolas. Matich won two Grands Prix\nis his own cars before Stewart and McRae each took a pair of wins. Towards the end of the 1970s , the race\nagain became a home to returning European-based antipode ans like Alan Jones and Larry Perkins with\nWarwick Brown winning the 1977 race, while in 1976 , touring car racer John Goss completed a\nremarkable doubl e becoming the only driver to win the Grand Prix and the Bathurst 1000  touring car race.\nDeclining econom y and the dominance of the local scene by Group C touring cars towards the latter part of\nthe 1970s saw Formula 5000 gradually fall out of favour.

This event came after\ncontroversial events 2 weeks before at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, where Prost had crashed into his\nhated teammate Senna, and Senna got going again and finished 1st on the road but after political\ndiscussions was disqualified for cutting the chicane before the pit straight at Suzuka; the repercussions of\nwhich dawned on the race. McLaren had decided to appeal Senna's disqualification; so Senna still had a\nchance of winning the championship. The race was delayed for sometime and there were discussions about\nwhether the race should be started. Senna qualified on pole position, and had every intention of starting the\nrace. The circuit was still being hammered by rain and was covered by water, but the drivers, including\nProst relented and eventually they started.

Senna had crashed into Prost at the very first corner on the first lap of the race; and he\nwon the Drivers' Championship for the second time. The Australian Grand Prix that year was an incredibly\nexciting race: Senna led for 61 laps, but crashed near the entrance to the permanent race course because of\ngearbox problems. The race then turned into a dead-heat sprint between Nelson Piquet in his Benetton-Ford\nand Nigel Mansell in his Ferrari. Mansell charged through the field and repeatedly broke the lap record in\npursuit of his former Williams teammate. This almost ended in disaster when the Ferrari almost hit the\nBenetton at the end of the Brabham Straight in a last-ditch overtaking move on the last lap. Piquet won\nfrom the Ferraris of Mansell and Prost. There was pre-race controversy when Prost refused to take part in\nboth the annua l end of season drivers' photo and the special photo shoot with the World Champions in\nattendance (including legendary five-time champion Juan Manuel Fangio, three-time champions Sir Jack\nBrabham, Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, and Nelson Piquet; and other world champions James Hunt, Alan\nJones, Denny H ulme and Senna), as Prost was still disgusted and angry did not  wish to appear in the phot os\nwith Senna following their controversial first corner crash in the previous race in Japan which gave the\n1990  World Championship to Senna.\nThe 1991  race was notable for being held in extremely wet and tricky conditions and the race was\neventually stoppe d after 14 of the scheduled 82 laps and Ayrton Senna was declared the winner. Prost had\nbeen fired from Ferrari for making unsavory comments about the car after Suzuka; he did not compete in\nthis race. The Drivers' Championship had already been decided in Senna's favour; but the Constructors'\nChampionship was still yet to be decided between McLaren and Williams. Senna's victory plus his\nteammate Gerhard Berger's third gave McLaren its fourth consecutive Constructors' Championship;\nWilliams (which was behind McLaren in points) drivers Mansell finished second (but crashed near the\nrace's end at the chicane after the pits) and R iccardo Patrese finished fifth. This race held the record of being\nthe shortest ever Formula One race as it only lasted 52 kilometres (33 miles)/24 minutes. It would\neventually be surpassed by the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, which lasted three laps, but was classified after\nonly one official lap. Triple World Champion Nelson Piquet, who finished fifth, retired from Grand Prix\nracing following the race.\n1992 saw Senna drive very hard to try to stay with new world champion Mansell's dominant Williams; this\nended in Senna running into the back of Mansell at the last corner. Mansell retired from Formula One and\nwent to compete in CART in the United States; Senna's teammate Gerhard Berger won the race. 1993 saw\nSenna win what was to be his 41st and final victory and final race for McLaren ahead of Alain Prost, who\nwas competing in his final Formula One race in a Williams before he too retired. Senna embraced his once\nextremely bitter rival Prost on the podium. It was announc ed around this time that the Australian Grand Prix\nwould be moving to Melbourne for 1996.\nThe 1994  was to see yet another memorable weekend. Following his win at the Japanese Grand Prix,\nDamon Hill was now one point behind championship leader Michael Schumacher. Nigel Mansell, returning\nto Formula One in place of the late Senna, was on pole but a poor start resulted in the two championship\nrivals Hill and Schumacher battling for the lead. But on lap 36, Schumacher went off the track, a result of\noversteer, and this allowed Hill to catch up with Schumacher and take the inside line for the next corner.\nSchumacher turned in on Hill's Williams (whether on purpose or accidentally remains unknow n) which sent\nthe Benetton up on two wheels and into the tyre barrier, Schumacher retiring on the spot. Hill came out of\nthe incident with a broken wishbone  on his front-left suspension, he pitted and retired from the race,\nhanding the title to Schumacher. The sister Williams of the 41-year-old Nigel Mansell went on to win the\nrace, becoming the oldest Grand Prix winner since Jack Brabham in 1970.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4335, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bf49810-4760-41ed-94ee-1edf0ad9e35c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bf49810-4760-41ed-94ee-1edf0ad9e35c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "31125705-c90d-4364-a24c-1a3212d03330", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "f194c9f6daed680b1f4682c77ee22ae2f7ebc365642994309d99765a568c7e78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Albert Park Circuit (1996\u20132020)\nDemonstration event held in\nMelbourne just before the start of the\n2005 Grand PrixIn 1995 , Mika H\u00e4kkinen suffered a tyre failure at the early part of the first qualifying session at the high\nspeed Brewery Bend be tween Jones and B rabham Straights, which resulted in him crashing he avily into the\noutside wall. He was critically injured in the crash and was saved only due to an emergency\ncricothyroidotomy that was performed by the side of the track by Sid Watkins.[18] This incident forged a\nstrong bond between H\u00e4kkinen and team principal Ron Dennis, and also sent forth a new movement for\nextra safety in the sport.

The decision to hold the\nrace there was controversial. A series of protests were organised by\nthe \"Save Albert Park\" group, which claimed that the race turned a\npublic park into a private playground for one week per year.\nAdditionally, they claimed that the race cost a great deal of money that would be better spent, if it were to\nbe spent on motor racing, on a permanent circuit elsewhere. Finally, they said that the claimed econom ic\nbenefits of the race were false or exaggerated. The race organisers and the gove rnment claimed that the\neconom ic benefits to the state, although unqua ntifiable, outweighed the costs, and hi ghlighted that the park's\npublic amenities have been greatly improved from the World War II vintage facilities previously located at\nAlbert Park; the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre (scene of many Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth\nGames events) being the centre piece and best know n of the revitalised facilities. Oppone nts of holding the\nrace in the park point out that the Aquatic Centre adds nothing to the Grand Prix, is effectively closed for\nweeks surroundi ng the event and could have been bui lt independent of the car race.\nBernie Ecclestone, the then president of Formula One Management,\nthe group that runs modern-day Formula One in conjunction with\nthe Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), once famously\nsaid that it took 10 minutes to do the deal with Melbourne that\nwould see the Victorian capital host the Australian Grand Prix from\n1996. It was though t that Melbourne's unsuccessful quest to stage\nthe 1996 Olympic Games, and the subsequently successful bid by\nnorthern rival city Sydne y to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, was a driving force behind Melbourne's\nmotivation to wrest the Australian Grand Prix away from Adelaide.

The logistics of creating\na temporary circuit and hosting an event of the magnitude of a\nFormula One Grand Prix from scratch were not lost on the\ninternational visitors, with Melbourne winning the F1\nConstructors' Association Award for the best organised Grand Prix of the year in its first two years (1996\nand 1997) .\nIt took just three corners for the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park to gain worldwide attention. On the\nfirst lap of the first race in 1996, J ordan's Martin Brundle was launched into the air in an enormous accident.\nFootage of the crash, and Brundle's subsequent rush back to the pits to take the spare car for the restart,\nensured the first race in Melbourne gained widespread coverage.

The next year was a\nMcLaren benefit, with Mika H\u00e4kkinen and Coulthard lapping\nthe entire field en route to a dominant 1\u20132 finish.

In the months before the Grand Prix, in consultation with\ndrivers,[30] the circuit unde rwent several significant revisions,[31][32] which were the first and most\nsignificant changes since the inaugural 1996 Australian Grand Prix,[33] including the first track resurfacing\nsince then.[34] Turns 9 and 10 were completely redesigned; where they formed a right\u2013left chicane with a\nheavy braking zone on the approach, the redesign saw them removed.[33] This was done  to raise the\napproach speed for old turns 11 and 12.[35] Several other corners were reprofiled to encourage overtaking,\nmost notably the old turn 13, which was widened to create additional racing lines.[36] Positive camber was\nalso added to allow drivers to carry more speed through the corner.[37] The main straight and pit lane were\nalso redesigned, with the pit lane wall moved two metres closer to the circuit so that the edge of the circuit\nsat directly next to the wall.[31] The 2022  Grand Prix saw Ferrari's Charles Leclerc achieve his first career\ngrand slam, having started in pole position, set the fastest lap, led every lap, and won the race ahead of Red\nBull's Sergio P\u00e9rez and Mercedes' George Russell.

Other\nprominent names to debut in Melbourne are seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton (2007) , three-time\nWorld Champion Max Verstappen (2015), two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso and one-time\nchampion Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n (both in 2001) ; former Australian F1 driver, Mark Webber, also made his debut\nthere in 2002.Calendar change", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4085, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7991903-c600-47c7-ab7e-39f9b83d74a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7991903-c600-47c7-ab7e-39f9b83d74a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b7207488-6fda-406b-96a3-88f620351338", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "b14b42e13e6adf723261fe2306ab3d56943bcc1ea02e5462506d670821eb4725", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As part of celebrations for the tenth running of the event at Albert Park in 2005, Webber drove his Williams\nF1 car over the Sydne y Harbour Bridge in a promotional event, and the Melbourne city streets hosted a\nparade of F1 machinery and Supercars, Australia's highest-profile domestic motor sport category. For over\nthirty years, Supercars have competed in the Supercars Challenge non-championship event at the Australian\nGrand Prix. In 2018 , the event was contested for championship points for the first time, and was known as\nthe Melbourne 400.[46][47]\nThe 2021 event was originally scheduled to open the season in March, but moved to November due to\nongoi ng COVID-19 restrictions and travel disruptions, then cancelled on 6 July.[48][49] It was also going\nthrough s everal changes to make the track faster.[50]\nAn issue that is frequently debated amongst both suppor ters and oppone nts of the Australian Grand Prix\ncentres around the event's econom ic impact for the state of Victoria; propone nts of the event claim that the\nevent increases tourism, creates jobs and generates millions of dollars for the state of Victoria, while\noppone nts dispute the event's econom ic benefits and cite the cost on taxpayers to host the event, as well as\nthe disruptions generated by the event.[51] In 2014, the Victorian gove rnment claimed the annua l econom ic\nimpact of hosting the Australian Grand Prix was between $32 million and $39 million, with the event\ngenerating significant econom ic, social and cultural benefits including job creation, industry development,\ninward investment and tourism, while oppone nts of the event claimed that the event cost Victorian\ntaxpayers over $50 m illion to hos t.[52]\nAccording to a 2022 econom ic impact assessment conduc ted by Ernst & Young , the 2022 Australian Grand\nPrix generated an estimated $92 million of direct spending in the Victorian econom y and boosted Victoria's\nGross State Produc t by an estimated $171 million, with the Grand Prix also credited for driving up hotel\noccupancy and stimulating patronage for hospitality businesses.[53] This mirrors a 2011 EY report\ncommissioned by Tourism Victoria, which found international exposure and tourism spending stemming\nfrom hosting the Grand Prix generated between $32.04 m illion and $39.34 m illion for Victoria's Gross State\nProduc t during the period in which the Grand Prix was held, while also generating between 351 and 411\nfull-time equivalent jobs.[54][55] According to an Econom ic Impact Assessment conduc ted by EY, the 2023\nAustralian Grand Prix contributed an estimated $268 million to the Victorian econom y, including $144\nmillion in direct expenditure and the creation of 1,149 full-time equivalent jobs,[56] with $128 million of\ndirect investment contributed by 81,000 i nternational and interstate visitors who attended the event.[57]\nHowever, a cost-benefit analysis of the Australian Grand Prix done  for the Auditor-General in 2005\nrevealed a net econom ic loss for Victoria, with the estimated costs of the event exceeding the benefits to\nVictorian taxpayers by 5 per cent,[58] a 2007 auditor-general's report found costs to host the event exceeded\nbenefits by $6.7 million,[59][60] while a 2012 report commissioned by Econom ists at Large for Save Albert\nPark estimated that the 2012 Grand Prix resulted in a net econom ic loss to Victoria of between $48.8m  and\n$66.7m , with a mid-range estimate of $60.55m .[61] The 2007 Australian Grand Prix ran at a $34.6 million\nloss,[62] while according to Crikey, the Australian Grand Prix made losses of $59.97 million in 2014, $61.7\nmillion in 2015, $61 m illion in 2016 a nd $57.1 m illion in 2017.[63]Economic impact", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0,
