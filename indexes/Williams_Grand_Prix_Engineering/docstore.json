The team was\nformed in 1977  after Frank Williams's earlier\nunsuccessful F1 operation: Frank Williams Racing\nCars (which later became Wolf\u2013Williams Racing in\n1976) . The team is based in Grove, Oxfordshire, on\na 60-acre (24 ha ) site.[5]\nThe team's first race was the 1977 Spanish Grand\nPrix, where the new team ran a March chassis for\nPatrick N\u00e8ve. Williams started manufacturing its\nown cars the following year, and Clay Regazzoni\nwon Williams's first race at the 1979 British Grand\nPrix. At the 1997 British Grand Prix, Jacques\nVilleneuve scored the team's 100th race victory,\nmaking Williams one of only five teams in Formula\nOne, alongs ide Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, and\nRed Bull Racing to win 100 races. Williams won\nnine Constructors' Championships between 1980\nand 1997 . This was a record until Ferrari won its\ntenth championship in 2000 .\nNotable drivers for Williams include: Alan Jones,\nKeke Rosberg, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill, David\nCoulthard, Jenson Button, Juan Pablo Montoya,\nAlain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna,\nRiccardo Patrese, Valtteri Bottas, Felipe Massa and\nJacques Villeneuve.

Williams also has business\ninterests beyond Formula One. They have established Williams\nAdvanced Engineering and Williams Hybrid Power, who take\ntechnology originally developed for Formula One and adapt it for\ncommercial applications. In April 2014 , Williams Hybrid Power\nwas sold to GKN. In May 2020, Williams announc ed they were\nseeking buyers for a portion of the team due to poor financial performance in 2019 and that they had\nterminated the contract of title spons or ROKiT. On 21 August 2020, Williams was acquired by Dorilton\nCapital. Frank and Claire Williams stepped down from being Manager and Deputy Manager of the team on\n6 September 2020, w ith the 2020 I talian Grand Prix being their last time in their respective positions.[6]\nFrank Williams founde d Williams in 1977 after his previous team,\nFrank Williams Racing Cars, failed to achieve the success he\ndesired. Despite the promise of a new owner, Canadian millionaire\nWalter Wolf, and the team's rebranding as Wolf\u2013Williams Racing in\n1976 , the cars still were not competitive. Eventually, Williams left\nthe rechristened Walter Wolf Racing and moved to Didcot to\nrebuild his team as Williams Grand Prix Engineering.

Lone driver Patrick N\u00e8ve\ncompeted in 11 races that year, starting with the Spanish Grand Prix. The new team\nfailed to score a point, achieving a best finish of 7th at the Italian Grand Prix.[8]\nFor the 1978  season, Patrick Head designed\nthe first Williams car: the FW06. Williams\nsigned Alan Jones, who had won the Austrian\nGrand Prix the previous season for a devastated Shadow team\nfollowing the death of their lead driver, Tom Pryce. Jones's first race\nfor the team was the Argentine Grand Prix where he qualified in\n14th position but retired after 36 laps due to a fuel system failure.\nThe team scored its first championship points two races later at the\nSouth African Grand Prix when Jones finished in fourth. Williams\nearnt their first podium at the United States Grand Prix, where\nJones came second, 20 seconds  behind the Ferrari of Carlos Reutemann.[9] Williams finished the season in\nninth place in the Constructors' Championship, with a respectable 11 points, while Alan Jones finished 11th\nin the Drivers' Championship. Towards the end of 1978, Frank Williams recruited Frank Dernie to join\nPatrick Head in the design of fice.\nHead designed the FW07 chassis and gearbox for the 1979  season with Frank Dernie picking up the\nsuspension, aerodyna mic development and skirt design. This was the team's first ground effect car, a\ntechnology that was first introduc ed by Colin Chapman and Team Lotus. Williams also obtained\nmembership of the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA) which expressed a preference for teams\nto run two cars, so Jones was joined at the team by Clay Regazzoni.[10] It was not until the seventh round\nof the championship, the Monaco Grand Prix, that they finished in the points. Regazzoni came close to\ntaking the team's first win but finished second, less than a second behind race winner Jody Scheckter. The\nnext race, the French Grand Prix, is remembered for the final lap battle between Ren\u00e9 Arnoux and Gilles\nVilleneuve, but also saw both cars finish in the points for the first time; as Jones was fourth with Regazzoni\nin sixth.[11] The team's first win came at the British Grand Prix (their home Grand Prix) when Regazzoni\nfinished 25 s econds  ahead of second pl ace.\nGreater success followed when Williams got a 1-2 finish at the next round in Germany, Jones in first with\nRegazzoni two seconds  behind in second. Jones then made it three wins in a row at the Austrian Grand\nPrix, finishing half a minute ahead of Gilles Villeneuve's Ferrari. Three wins in a row became four two\nweeks later at the Dutch Grand Prix, with Alan Jones winning yet again by a comfortable margin over Jody\nScheckter's Ferrari. Scheckter ended Williams's winning streak when he won the Italian Grand Prix; with\nRegazzoni finishing third behind Scheckter and Villeneuve. Alan Jones managed another win at the\npenultimate race in Canada to cap off a great season.1978 season\n1979 season", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3034, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08b67afd-f092-4ad3-85da-556e29602e0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "08b67afd-f092-4ad3-85da-556e29602e0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b16cf572-92f3-4f33-8d05-e43b539bd951", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering.pdf"}, "hash": "c65d0acd008e8985eee3a84dc0c01620d55c80575011bf351e99f7a693e6cc81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Keke Rosberg's FW08 used during\nthe 1982 season when Rosberg won\nthe Drivers' Championship recording\nonly a single win during the seasonWilliams had greatly improved their Constructors' Championship position, finishing eight places higher than\nthe previous year and scoring 59 more points.

Despite this success, Honda  ended their partnership with\nWilliams at the end of  the year in favour of McLaren.\nUnable to make a deal with another major engine manufacturer, Williams used naturally aspirated Judd\nengines for the 1988  season.[13] This left them with a significant performance deficit compared with their\nturbo-powered rivals. Piquet left Williams to join Lotus who had retained their Honda  engines for the 1988\nseason, helped by having Satoru Nakajima as number 2 driver to Piquet. Nelson Piquet called Frank Dernie\nevery week to persuade him to join Lotus. Eventually Dernie moved to Lotus to become their new\nTechnical Director. Williams brought  in Riccardo Patrese to replace Piquet. The team did not win a race that\nseason and finished seventh in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 20 points. The highlights of the\nseason for the team were two second-place finishes by Mansell. When Mansell was forced to miss two\nraces due to illness, he was replaced by Martin Brundle for Belgium and Jean-Louis Schlesser for Italy.\nSchlesser's collision with Ayrton Senna in that race would deny McLaren a clean sweep of race wins that\nseason.\nThe team secured Renault as their engine supplier in 1989. Renault engines subsequently powered\nWilliams's drivers to another four Drivers' and five Constructors' Championships up until Renault's\ndeparture from Formula One at the end of 1997. The team brought  in Adrian Newey to replace Frank\nDernie.

Mansell had a record-breaking 1992\nseason, w inning the title in record time and leading num erous races from pole to finish.\nThe Renault era started in 1989 , with Riccardo Patrese and Thierry\nBoutsen at the helm of the two Williams cars. Boutsen replaced\nMansell, who had signed a contract with Ferrari. The engine's first\nGrand Prix in Brazil was one that the team would prefer to forget:\nBoutsen retired with an engine failure and Patrese with an alternator\nfailure. Williams managed to get back on track with Boutsen\nfinishing in fourth at the next race in Italy; winning the team three\npoints.

At the sixth round in\nCanada, Williams not only scored their first win with the Renault engine but also their first one-two: with\nBoutsen finishing in first followed by Patrese in second.

Despite this, there\nlooke d to be significant uphe aval at Williams for 1993;  what\nfollowed led to a domino effect that had not only effects on the\nWorld Championship, but also the CART-sanctioned PPG IndyC ar\nSeries.\nWilliams was interested in signing Alain Prost to drive one of its two cars for 1993 as he was returning from\nhis year long sabbatical after being sacked by Scuderia Ferrari during the 1991 World Championship.\nPatrese, perhaps figuring that he would be the driver being sacked in order for Prost to take one of the two\navailable rides, decided to leave after driving for Williams since 1987. He would join up with Benetton,\nwhere he would replace Martin Brundle alongs ide Michael Schumacher in the team's Camel-backed Fords.\nMansell, meanwhile, was not pleased that Williams was looking to bring Prost aboard. Prost and Gerhard\nBerger had essentially swapped rides after the 1989 season with Prost becoming Mansell's teammate at\nFerrari. The acrimonious relationship between the two that ensued nearly resulted in Mansell retiring from\nthe sport altogether and he had not forgotten this; as such, Mansell began looking for other options to\ncontinue his racing career. He eventually decided to move over to CART, where he paired with Mario\nAndretti at Newman/Haas Racing.\nThat seat, meanwhile, had opened up because Andretti's son, Michael, was leaving CART to replace\nBerger at McLaren. McLaren also was potentially dealing with losing a driver, as Ayrton Senna's contract\nhad expired following the 1992 season. In addition to this, McLaren's arrangement with Honda  to provide\nengines had also expired, and the team had signed to run Ford engines for 1993. With McLaren having\nfallen behind Williams on the grid, combined with his uncertainty regarding the new engine supplier, Senna\napproached Williams and offered to take over the second car. His interest was such that he was willing to\ndrive for Williams while collecting no s alary.\nHowever, like with Mansell, Prost had a rather testy relationship with Senna from when the two were\nteammates and rivals at McLaren in the 1980s . As such, he negotiated a two-year contract with Williams\nthat gave him the power to approve or disapprove any driver Williams would seek to have him team with\nfor 1993. Once the contract was signed, Prost used that power to freeze Senna out of driving for Williams;\nhe would return to McLaren for one more season w ith the team running Ford engines.\nNeeding a replacement, Williams decided not to pursue any of the available drivers such as Berger and\nBrundle. Instead, they chose to promote former Brabham driver Damon Hill, who had been their test driver\nsince Brabham collapsed and folded dur ing the 1992 s eason, to join Prost in the other Renault.1992 off-season\n1993 season", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3367, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47f891e0-5590-4429-81b9-2610bb9a1244": {"__data__": {"id_": "47f891e0-5590-4429-81b9-2610bb9a1244", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db68f399-6b5e-4da4-9172-33d7b97532e7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering.pdf"}, "hash": "fa3b7b9c16535ec7776bbb7e3a390ec24754a1e844596f1b9873b2da35330505", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Williams FW16B used in the second\nhalf of the 1994 season when\nRothmans debuted as the team's\nprimary backerThe Williams FW15C was an extremely dominant car, with active suspension and traction control systems\nbeyond anything available to the other teams.[14] Prost won on his debut for the team in South Africa and,\nlike Mansell, dominated the weekend, taking pole position and finishing a minute ahead of Senna, who was\nsecond.

To appease Prost, who decided to retire from racing permanently after Senna's signing,\nWilliams agreed to pay him his full salary for the second ha lf of the contract.\nGiven this was the same team that had won the previous two World Championships with vastly superior\ncars, Senna was a natural and presumptive pre-season title favourite, with second-year driver Damon Hill\nintended to play the suppor ting role.
