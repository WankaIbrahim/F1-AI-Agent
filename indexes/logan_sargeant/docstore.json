At Silvers tone, he achieved his first pole position in the series and converted it into his first victory . At\nthe Red Bull Ring , he qualif ied third and finished the feature race fourth. However , the disqualif ication of race winner\nRichard Verschoor and time penalties for Jehan Daruvala  and Roberto Merhi  meant that Sargeant inherited his second\nconsecutive feature race win.[28] This result promot ed him to second place in the championship, with 115 points to\nteammate Lawson's 60.[29]\nThat victory would ultimately be his final podium finish of the season. He achieved another pole position at the next\nround at Circuit Paul Ricard , but retired from the feature race after stalling in the pits. More retirements came in the\nsprint races at the Hungaroring  and at Spa-Francorchamps , both due to accidents.
