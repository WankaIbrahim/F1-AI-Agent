Sargeant achieved two wins, two pole positions and four total\npodiums over the year.\nIn October 2021, on the weekend of the United States Grand Prix, it was announc ed that Sargeant had joined the Williams\nDriver Academy.[29][30] He drove a Formula One car for the first time in the Yas Marina Circuit post-season test at the\nwheel of the Williams FW43B,[31] which he described as an \"experience of a lifetime.\"[32]\nSargeant made his Formula One practice debut with Williams at the 2022 United States Grand Prix,[33] making him the\nfirst American driver to take part in a Grand Prix weekend session since Alexander Rossi in 2015 . Williams' team principal\nJost Capito stated that his debut \"was a pleasure and pressure for Sargeant\".[34] Capito also confirmed that Sargeant would\ndrive for Williams in 2023 , replacing the outgoing Nicholas Latifi, provided he obtained the necessary FIA Super Licence\npoints by finishing at least fifth (or sixth without any penalty points) in his Formula 2 campaign.[35] Capito also commented\nthat Sargeant's American nationality was \"not the initiation for the decision\" to promote him.[36]\nSargeant drove the FW44 in further practice sessions at the Mexico City, S\u00e3o Paulo and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix.[37][38] He\nachieved the required Super Licence points at the Abu Dhabi weekend and was officially announc ed as a 2023 Williams\nrace driver the following da y.[39] He chose 2 as his permanent driver num ber, last used by Stoffel Vandoor ne in 2018 .[40]\nSargeant qualified 16th for the season opener at Bahrain International Circuit, setting an identical lap time to McLaren's Lando Norris but missing out on advancing\nto the second qualifying session (Q2) as Norris set his time first.[41] He finished the race twelfth, two places behind teammate Alex Albon. After the race, Sargeant\ncommented that he was \"very, very happy\"  with his debut race but was disappointed to miss out on Q2.[42] He failed to set a meaningful lap time in qualifying at\nthe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. He subsequently started from last place and went on to finish 16th.[43] He retired from the Australian Grand Prix after colliding with2021\nFIA Formula 2 Championship\nFormula One\nWilliams (2023\u20132024)\n2023 season: Debut", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3327, "end_char_idx": 6216, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bebdfb9-d4a6-4739-b466-fba5d1d61133": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bebdfb9-d4a6-4739-b466-fba5d1d61133", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "logan_sargeant.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9830f498-9b09-41c7-85b5-78f12150f5d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "logan_sargeant.pdf"}, "hash": "3114a59bbb2d9ca6f82fca33648aeab32ad519f9f16c1f194f0ab2a2249d240b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3201885-1f57-46e0-b243-3fdd2ac2c31b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fa95bdb29332008c4854efdba1e381e4d699d9985ed1daa52074f9ca650f686", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sargeant at the 2023 Austrian Grand\nPrix\nSargeant at the 2024 Austrian Grand\nPrixNyck de Vries at the third restart and was classified 16th.

He received a penalty for colliding with Bottas in the\nearly laps, with the damage ultimately causing both cars to retire from the race. He retired from the Qatar Grand Prix sprint after spinning into the gravel, and later\nwithdrew from the race after 40 laps due to heat stroke and dehydration, symptoms experienced by other drivers due to the extreme weather conditions.[51][52] He\nstarted 16th at the United States Grand Prix but improved to finish 12th. He was later promoted to 10th after the disqualifications of Lewis Hamilton and Charles\nLeclerc, making Sargeant the first American driver to score a point in Formula One since Michael Andretti at the 1993 Italian Grand Prix. He failed to set a\nqualifying time at the Mexico City Grand Prix and later retired from the race with a fuel pump issue. He then improved from 19th on the grid at the S\u00e3o Paulo\nGrand Prix to 11th at the finish. He achieved his career best qualifying performance at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, starting sixth, but both Williams drivers droppe d\noutside the points at the finish.
