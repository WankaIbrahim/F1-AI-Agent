It first appeared as a non-\nchampionship event in 1962 before being held as\na championship event in 1963\u20131970 and 1986\u2013\n1992. The Grand Prix returned in 2015  at the\nMexico City circuit, and held the event from 2015\nto 2019, and since 2021;  it was due to host the\nGrand Prix in 2020, but this was cancelled in\nrespose to the COVID-19 pandemic. The venue is\ncontracted to hos t the event until 2025.\nThe Mexican Grand Prix was first held on 4\nNovember 1962 at the Magdalena Mixhuc a\ncircuit. The circuit was the first international\nracetrack in Mexico, and like Monza in Milan,\nItaly, it was built within a park in the center part of\na major city, in this case the Mexican capital of\nMexico City. The race provided unique challenges\nfor racing, standing at 2,240m  (7,340 ft) above  sea\nlevel, as well as the long, 180-degree, lightly\nbanked and fast Peraltada corner that finishes the\nlap, in addition to being a bumpy racetrack from\nactively shifting soils beneath the circuit. The\nMexican Grand Prix of this period was always the\nseason finale Grand Prix, he ld in late October.\nThe first race, a non-championship affair which\nattracted a strong international entry, was won by Team Lotus with Jim Clark taking over the car of\nteammate Trevor Taylor to claim the win; Clark was black-flagged after receiving a push-start at a confused\nrace start. The meeting was marred by the death of young Mexican star Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, killed in\npractice in a Rob W alker run Lotus 24 on the Peraltada.History\nMagdalena Mixhuca (1962\u20131970)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2389, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "168f8d66-e9a9-4f17-9769-aca1ded9284b": {"__data__": {"id_": "168f8d66-e9a9-4f17-9769-aca1ded9284b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13fa59fa-e550-44f1-acb7-bc2583496723", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "c06e8a1a3e21e89dec0e2967158798788a82c995e380e8a4f0ca072579139eae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Classic Mexican GP event logo.The Formula One World Championship arrived the following year with Clark winning again, equalling\nJuan Manuel Fangio's record of most victories in a single season. 1964 saw the battle for both the Drivers'\nand Constructors' championships. British drivers Clark, John Surtees and Graham Hill all arrived with a\nchance, with Hill leading the table, and Ferrari, BRM and Lotus were in contention for the Constructors'\nChampionship. Ferrari signalled Lorenzo Bandini to let teammate Surtees through, which he did, and\nSurtees finished second behind Gurney to win the championship by one point; Ferrari won the\nConstructors' Championship.\nAmerican Richie Ginther took victory for Honda  in 1965, the Japanese company's first win in Formula\nOne. Clark won his third Mexican Grand Prix in 1967, making him the most frequent winner of the race as\nof 2019.\nIn 1968, three men again came into the race with a chance of winning the Drivers' Championship: Hill, his\ncountryman Jackie Stewart, and New Zealander and defending world champion Denny Hulme. The race\nwas a straight fight between Hill and Stewart; the Scotsman led for several laps until Hill passed him.\nHulme was running third, but he had a rear suspension failure and crashed on Lap 11. Swiss Jo Siffert\ndecided to get in on the mix and took the lead, but he had to pit with a broken throttle cable. Stewart then\nfell back when his engine started to misfire, and he experienced handling and fuel-feed problems. Hill had\nno pr oblems and took vi ctory and hi s second dr iver's championship.\nCrowd control in 1968 and 1970 contributed to cancellation of the event.[1] In 1970, a record crowd of\napproximately 200,000 arrived to see Pedro Rodr\u00edguez, forcing officials to delay the race start by an hour as\nthey struggled to control the crowd.[2] At one point, a dog ran across the track and was hit by Stewart.\nDuring the race, spectators threw bottles on the track.[2] Amid the chaos, Clay Regazzoni trailed Jacky Ickx\nfor a 1-2 Ferrari finish.[2]\nThe 1971 event was scheduled, with a large fund deposited in a Swiss bank to help guarantee better crowd\ncontrol, but after the death of Pedro Rodriguez, the plan was abandone d.[2]\nThere had been a number of attempts to bring the Mexican Grand\nPrix back on the F1 calendar, one attempt being when it was\noriginally scheduled in April 1980, two weeks after the US Grand\nPrix West, but was cancelled. American IndyC ars arrived for a brief\ntwo-year visit in 1980 and 1981, racing as the Gran Premio Tecate on\nthe Magdalena Mixhuc a track now named after Mexico's two lost\nracing heroes, Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez. The event was\ndominated by Rick Mears. A number of years later, work began on\nrebuilding the Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez circuit with much improved organisation. The circuit's layout was\nslightly shorter, the Peraltada's banking had been eased and the circuit was generally much safer than it had\nbeen. The Grand Prix returned in 1986, where the race played host to Austrian Gerhard Berger's first win in\nhis Benetton B186, in a race where an ill Berger outlasted his oppos ition, as tyre problems struck most of\nthe field. The circuit was still very rough and bumpy. 1987 saw the race being run in two parts. It was\nstoppe d around mid-distance when Briton Derek Warwick crashed heavily coming out of the Peraltada.\nBrazilian driver Nelson Piquet finished first on the road, but because his Williams teammate Nigel Mansell\nwas 30 seconds  ahead when the first race ended, Mansell kept Piquet in sight and won the race on\ncumulative time.Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez (1986\u20131992)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3614, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21ce0693-b9ac-4b1d-8b04-40482abe1695": {"__data__": {"id_": "21ce0693-b9ac-4b1d-8b04-40482abe1695", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7e4e377-e839-413f-8533-355f5d0ee4ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "1de814ae112225dc73d8f4f7f5ff505232dceee815690c726a51928a9a6bc1bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The 1988 race was moved from mid-October to a warmer and more rain-prone late May season slot, so that\nit could be paired with the other North American Grands Prix in Montreal and Detroit. This race saw\nFrenchman Alain Prost dominate in his McLaren, and Prost's Brazilian teammate Ayrton Senna won the\nnext year; this was at a time when the two men's relationship was at a low point. 1990 saw the race moved\nto late June. Prost, now at Ferrari, qualified 13th on the grid but drove through the field and took second\nfrom his teammate Mansell late in the race. Senna, who was leading, had a slow punc ture that turned into\nshredded rubbe r, and he went into the pits to have it changed, but the suspension was too badly damaged\nfor the Brazilian to continue. This put Prost and Mansell 1\u20132, but Senna's teammate Gerhard Berger was\nchallenging Mansell for second; Berger passed the Englishman going into the Moises Solana esses, but\nMansell repassed him around the outside of the Peraltada on the same lap. Prost won the race; Mansell and\nBerger finished second and third. 1991 saw Senna crash heavily at the Peraltada during practice; he was\ndeclared fit to race by FIA doctor Sid Watkins; he finished third behind Williams drivers Riccardo Patrese\nand Mansell; but Senna had been critical of the severely bumpy circuit all of that weekend. On 9 October\n1991, European media sources reported that promoters barely made enough funds  to pay off F1 for the\n1991 r ace. FISA demanded improvements to the track for the 1992 e vent, which were made.[3]\nFor the 1992 season, the race had been moved further forward to March, and on 20 February of that year,\nMexico City's air pollution had reached a record level. City officials had imposed emergency measures\nbanning ha lf of gove rnment cars and equipment from the streets; this was not helped by t he fact that Mexico\nCity is situated in a valley surrounde d by mountains, which restricts polluted air to travel elsewhere to\ndissipate. This put extra stress on the Mexican Grand Prix committee to ensure the track was ready for\n1992.[4] Some safety measures had been implemented to the track, including further easing of the banking\nat Peraltada, making the corner a little slower; this was done  to avoid bypa ssing the entry to this corner via\nmaking an alternate route to the middle of the Peraltada through the park's baseball stadium. Although the\ncircuit was popul ar with drivers, they complained during interviews with the press about the ubiquitous and\nsevere bumps on the circuit, which had decayed even further and were worse than before - even the\nPeraltada was very bumpy and Mansell nearly crashed there during practice. Despite these concerns, the\nrace that year went ahead and saw Williams teammates Mansell and Patrese dominate the race. Senna had\nanother bad accident during practice, this time at the fast Esses - Senna went over a nasty series of bumps\nthat unsettled the car to the point where Senna lost control, went off the track and hi t a concrete wall; he had\nminor injuries but qualified sixth and took part in the race. But the state of the track, the decline of Mexico\nCity itself, not only with air pollution problems but also a rapid and unstable city popul ation increase, saw\nFormula One leave again.\n2002 saw the revival of the Grand Prix of Mexico for Champ Cars on a much modified version of the\nAut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez circuit, which included cutting the Peraltada in half. This was a six-year\nstay, which saw S\u00e9bastien Bourdais win half of the six races that followed.\nRumors first surfaced in 2003 that the Mexican Grand Prix might return to the Formula One calendar at a\nnew $70 million circuit, dubbe d \"Mantarraya\", to be built near Canc\u00fan.[5] In 2005, the gove rnor of\nQuintana Roo state said that Mexico would have a Grand Prix on the calendar for 2006 .[6] The plan was\nhalted later that year as a debate arose about whether the land the circuit was to be built on was properly\nowned by t he right people to do s o.[7]Absence (1993\u20132014)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4034, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32d741be-e8d0-45c7-aa6f-6592be87eb90": {"__data__": {"id_": "32d741be-e8d0-45c7-aa6f-6592be87eb90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce51be37-c63a-4409-869f-b95dfbf8c710", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "b5c802fe69539783470be7dbef5fa60b7b628a8844d7e71763aef02312ab8edd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Seven-time World Champion Lewis\nHamilton clinched his fourth and fifth\ntitles in 2017 and 2018 respectively\nat the Mexican Grand Prix.After the 2006 United States Grand Prix, Bernie Ecclestone announc ed that the Grand Prix of Mexico\nwould return for the 2009  season, but  nothing further came from the announc ement.\nIn Augus t 2011, Carlos Slim Domit revealed plans for a revived\nrace.[8] In Augus t 2013, it was sugge sted by \"high level sources\"\nthat the Mexican Grand Prix could be on the provisional 2014\nWorld Championship calendar.[9] A preliminary draft calendar for\nthe 2014 season, circulated in early September 2013, assigned 9\nNovember 2014 for the Mexican Grand Prix, but did not specify a\ncircuit and noted that the event was \"subject to confirmation\".[10]\nOn 5 December 2013, the FIA released the official 2014 Formula\nOne season calendar, and the Mexican Grand Prix was not on the\ncalendar; then the FIA announc ed that the Mexican Grand Prix was\npostpone d to 2015 due to lack of sufficient preparation time to\nupgrade the somewhat run-down Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez circuit to\nFormula 1 working standards.[11] In July 2014, Ecclestone confirmed that he had signed a 5-year deal for\nthe Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez track to host the Mexican Grand Prix, starting in 2015.[12] On 3 December 2014,\nthe FIA published a confirmed calendar for 2015[13] showing the 2015 Grand Prix of Mexico on 1\nNovember 2015.
