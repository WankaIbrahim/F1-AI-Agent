Run since 1929, it is widely considered to\nbe one of the most important and prestigious\nautomobile races in the world,[1][2][3] and is one of\nthe races\u2014along with the Indianapolis 500 and the\n24 Hours of Le Mans\u2014that form the Triple Crown of\nMotorsport.[4] It is the only Grand Prix that does not\nadhere to the FIA's mandated 305-kilometre (190-\nmile) minimum race distance for Formula One\nraces.[5]\nThe race is held on a narrow course laid out in the\nstreets of Monaco, with many elevation changes and\ntight corners as well as the tunne l, making it one of\nthe most demanding circuits in Formula One. In spite\nof the relatively low average speeds, the Monaco\ncircuit is a dangerous place to race due to how\nnarrow the track is, and the race often involves the\nintervention of  a safety car.\nThe first Monaco Grand Prix took place on 14 April\n1929, and the race eventually became part of the pre-\nSecond World War European Championship and was\nincluded in the first World Championship of Drivers\nin 1950 .

The principality's first Grand Prix\nwas organised in 1929 by Antony Nogh\u00e8 s, under the auspices of\nPrince Louis II, through the Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM),\nof which he was president.[11] The ACM organised the Rallye\nAutomobile Monte Carlo, and in 1928 applied to the Association\nInternationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus  (AIACR), the\ninternational gove rning body of motorsport, to be upgraded from a\nregional French club to full national status. Their application was\nrefused due to the lack of a major motorsport event held wholly\nwithin Monaco's bounda ries. The rally could not be considered, as\nit mostly used the roads of other European countries.[12]\nTo attain full national status, Nogh\u00e8 s proposed the creation of an automobile Grand Prix in the streets of\nMonte Carlo.[13] He obtained the official sanction of Prince Louis II and the suppor t of Mon\u00e9gasque Grand\nPrix driver Louis Chiron. Chiron thought  Monaco's topogr aphy was well-suited to setting up a race\ntrack.[12]\nThe first race, held on 14 April 1929, was won by William Grover-Williams (using the pseudonym\n\"Williams\"), driving a works Bugatti Type 35B.[6][14] It was an invitation-only event, but not all of those\nwho were invited decided to attend. The leading Maserati and Alfa Romeo drivers decided not to compete,\nbut Bugatti was well represented. Mercedes sent their leading driver, Rudolf Caracciola. Starting fifteenth,\nCaracciola drove a fighting race, taking his SSK into the lead before wasting 41\u20442 minutes on refuelling and\na tyre change to finish second.[6][15] Another driver who competed using a pseudonym  was \"Georges\nPhilippe\", the Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Chiron was unable to compete, having a prior commitment to\ncompete in the Indianapolis 500.[12]\nCaracciola's SSK was refused permission to race the following year,[15] but Chiron did compete (in the\nworks Bugatti Type 35C), when he was beaten by privateer Ren\u00e9 Dreyfus and his Bugatti Type 35B, and\nfinished second. Chiron took victory in the 1931 race driving a Bugatti. He remained the only native of\nMonaco to have won the event until 2024.[16]\nThe race quickly grew in importance after its inception. Because of the high number of races which were\nbeing termed 'Grands Prix', the AIACR formally recognised the most important race of each of its affiliated\nnational automobile clubs as International Grands Prix, or Grande s \u00c9preuves, and in 1933 Monaco wasHistory\nOrigins\nPre-war", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2965, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26e3b252-73d7-4af5-b064-27d09f13d13c": {"__data__": {"id_": "26e3b252-73d7-4af5-b064-27d09f13d13c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Monaco_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e72aa82f-650d-4ca9-95bf-f0c071bcdac9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Monaco_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "e7beaaf9c048de80904e6648461673969382e133d3e45c6e792ef822224d78f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ranked as such alongside the French, Belgian, Italian, and Spanish Grands Prix.[17] That year's race was the\nfirst Grand Prix in which grid positions were decided, as they are now, by practice time rather than the\nestablished method of balloting. The race saw Achille Varzi and Tazio Nuvolari exchange the lead many\ntimes before the race settled in Varzi's favour on the final lap when Nuvolari's car caught fire.[18]\nThe race became a round of the new European Championship in 1936, when stormy weather and a broken\noil line led to a series of crashes, eliminating the Mercedes-Benzes of Chiron, Fagioli, and von Brauchitsch,\nas well as Bernd Rosemeyer's Typ C for newcomer Auto Union; Rudolf Caracciola, proving the truth of his\nnickname, Regenmeister (Rainmaster), went on to win.[19] In 1937, von Brauchitsch duelled Caracciola\nbefore coming out on top.[20] It was the last prewar Grand Prix at Monaco, for in 1938, the lack of profits\nfor organisers, and demand for nearly \u00a3500 (approximately \u00a340000 adjusted to 2023 inflation[21]) in\nappearance money per top entrant led AIACR to cancel the event, while looming war overtook it in 1939,\nand the Second W orld War ended organised racing in Europe until 1945.[22]\nRacing in Europe started again on 9 September 1945 at the Bois de Boulogne  Park in the city of Paris, four\nmonths and one day after the end of the war in Europe.[23] However, the Monaco Grand Prix was not run\nbetween 1945 and 1947 due to financial reasons.[24] In 1946, a new premier racing category, Grand Prix,\nwas defined by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the successor of the AIACR, based on\nthe pre-war voiturette class. A Monaco Grand Prix was run to this formula in 1948 , won by t he future world\nchampion Nino Farina in a Maserati 4CLT.[25][26]\nThe 1949 event was cancelled due to the death of Prince Louis II;[24] it was included in the new Formula\nOne World Drivers' Championship the following year. The race provided future five-time world champion\nJuan Manuel Fangio with his first win in a World Championship race, as well as third place for the 51-year-\nold Louis Chiron, his best result in the World Championship era. However, there was no race in 1951 due\nto budge tary concerns and a lack of regulations in the sport.[27]\n1952 was the first of the two years in which the World Drivers' Championship was run to less powerful\nFormula Two regulations. The race was run to sports car rules instead, and it did not form part of the World\nChampionship.[6]\nNo races were held in 1953 or  1954 due  to the fact that the car regulations were not finalized.[27]\nThe Monaco Grand Prix returned in 1955, again as part of the Formula One World Championship, and this\nwould begin a streak of 64 consecutive years in which the race was held.[28] In the 1955 race, Maurice\nTrintignant won in Monte Carlo for the first time and Chiron again scored points and at 56 became the\noldest driver to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix.

He first won in 1963,\nand then won the next two years.[6] In the 1965 race, he took pole position\nand led from the start, but went up an escape road on lap 25 to avoid hitting\na slow backmarker. Re-joining in fifth place, Hill set several new lap\nrecords on the way to winning.[31] The race was also notable for Jim\nClark's absence (he was participating in the Indianapolis 500), and for Paul\nHawkins's Lotus ending up in the harbour.[32] Hill's teammate, Briton\nJackie Stewart, won in 1966 and New Zealander Denny Hulme won in\n1967, but Hill won the next two years, the 1969 event being his final\nFormula One championship victory, by which time he was a doubl e\nFormula One world champion.[33]\nBy the start of the 1970s , efforts by Jackie Stewart saw several Formula\nOne events cancelled because of safety concerns. For the 1969 event, Armco barriers were placed at\nspecific points for the first time in the circuit's history. Before that, the circuit's conditions were (aside from\nthe removal of people's produc tion cars parked on the side of the road) virtually identical to everyday road\nuse. If a driver went off, he had a chance to crash into whatever was next to the track (buildings, trees, lamp\nposts, glass window s, and even a train station), and in Alberto Ascari's and Paul Hawkins's cases, the\nharbour water, because the concrete road the course used had no Armco to protect the drivers from going\noff the track and into the Mediterranean. The circuit gained more Armco in specific points for the next two\nraces, and by 1972,  the circuit was almost completely Armco-lined. For the first time in its history, the\nMonaco circuit was altered in 1972, as the pits were moved next to the waterfront straight between the\nchicane and Tabac, and the chicane was moved further forward right before Tabac, becoming the junction\npoint between the pits and the course. The course was changed again for the 1973 race. The Rainier III\nNautical Stadium was constructed where the straight that went behind the pits was, and the circuit\nintroduc ed a doubl e chicane that went around the new swimming pool (this chicane complex is know n\ntoday as \"Swimming Pool\"). This created space for a whole new pit facility, and in 1976 the course was\naltered yet again; the Sainte Devote corner was made slower and a chicane was placed right before the pit\nstraight.[34]\nBy the early 1970s , as Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone started to marshal the collective bargaining\npower of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), Monaco was prestigious enough to become\nan early bone  of contention. Historically, the number of cars permitted in a race was decided by the race\norganiser, in this case the ACM, which had always set a low number of around  16. In 1972, Ecclestone\nstarted to negotiate deals which relied on FOCA guaranteeing at least 18 entrants for every race. A stand-off\nover this issue left the 1972 race in jeopardy until the ACM gave in and agreed that 26 cars could\nparticipate \u2013 the same number permitted at most other circuits.

Prost, already a\nwinner of the suppor t race for Formula Three cars in 1979, took his first Monaco win at the 1984 race. The\nrace started 45 minutes late after heavy rain. Prost led briefly before Nigel Mansell overtook him on lap 11.\nMansell crashed out five laps later, letting Prost back into the lead. On lap 27, Prost led from Ayrton Senna's\nToleman and Stefan Bellof's Tyrrell. Senna was catching Prost, and Bellof was catching both of them in the\nonly naturally aspirated car in the race. However, on lap 31, the race was controversially stoppe d due to\nconditions deemed to be undriveable. Later, FISA fined the clerk of the course, Jacky Ickx, $6,000 and\nsuspended his licence for not consulting the stewards before stopping the race.[39] The drivers received onl y\nhalf of the points that would usually be awarded, as the race had been stoppe d before two-thirds of the\nintended race distance had been completed.[40]\nProst won 1985 after polesitter Senna retired with a blown Renault engine in his Lotus after over-revving it\nat the start, and Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari retook the lead twice, but he went off the track at Sainte-\nDevote, where Brazilian Nelson Piquet and Italian Riccardo Patrese had a huge  accident only a few laps\npreviously and oil and debris littered the track. Prost passed Alboreto, who retook the Frenchman, and then\nhe punc tured a tyre after running over bodyw ork debris from the Piquet/Patrese accident, which droppe d\nhim to 4th.

However,\na critical strategical error[57][58] meant Leclerc would drop to fourth, with Verstappen's teammate Sergio\nP\u00e9rez winning the race. The race was delayed due to heavy rain; two formation laps were completed before\nthe start procedure was suspended and further delayed an hour from its 15:00 local time intended start. In\naddition to a red flag due to a big crash from Mick Schumacher, this droppe d the laps completed from the\nintended 78 t o 64.\nIn September 2022, the Grand Prix signed a new race contract to remain on the F1 calendar until the 2025\nseason.[59] As part of this deal, the ACM relinquished advertising rights and television coverage to Formula\nOne Management, with previous races having their television coverage produc ed by T\u00e9l\u00e9 Monte-\nCarlo.[60][61]\nThe 2024 Grand Prix saw Charles Leclerc, driving for Ferrari, taking pole position for the third time around\nthe principality of Monaco. The race was red-flagged after a heavy crash involving the Haas of Kevin\nMagnus sen making contact with previous race winner Sergio P\u00e9rez and his Haas teammate Nico\nH\u00fclkenberg. Leclerc won from pole position after fending off Oscar Piastri to become the second\nMon\u00e9gasque to win after Louis Chiron w on the 1931 e dition of  the race.\nThe Grand Prix takes place on the Circuit de Monaco which\ntraverses the narrow city streets of Monte Carlo and La Conda mine\nalongs ide Monaco's harbour, Port Hercules. It has hosted the Grand\nPrix every time it has been run since 1929 \u2013 only the Italian Grand\nPrix, which has been held at Autodromo Nazionale Monza during\nevery Formula One regulated year except 1980 , has a similarly\nlengthy and close relationship with a single circuit.[62]\nThe race circuit has many elevation changes, tight corners, and a\nnarrow course that requires millimetre accuracy and makes it one of\nthe most demanding tracks in Formula One racing.[63][64] Drivers\nwill often touch the track walls to achieve a fast lap time. In 1929, La Vie Automobile magazine offered the\nopinion that \"Any respectable traffic system would have covered the track with <<Danger>> sign pos ts left,\nright and centre\".[65] As of 2022 , two drivers have crashed and ended up in the harbour, the most famous\nbeing Alberto Ascari in 1955 .[66][67] Despite unde rgoing minor changes throughout  its history, the circuit is\nlargely unchanged since 1929 and remains widely regarded as the ultimate test of driving skills and mental\nstrength. If Monaco were not already an existing Grand Prix, it is unlikely that its street circuit would be\npermitted to host Formula One due to its short track length and concerns with safety and overtaking.[68][69]\nHowever, as the 'Crown Jewel' of Formula One with a near century-old heritage in motorsport, Monaco is\ngranted some exceptions to accommodate its limited pos sibilities for expansion. [70][71]\nTriple Formula One champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing at Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle\naround your living room,\" illustrating the unique challenges posed by the circuit's narrow streets.[72][64] He\nfurther emphasized the significance of victory at Monaco by stating that \"a win here was worth twoCircuit", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3535, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff6d699c-3d31-41f6-90a8-d6c3ccd932a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff6d699c-3d31-41f6-90a8-d6c3ccd932a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Monaco_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f0805fa-79df-46ea-82a1-74a1d8bde108", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Monaco_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "2800fe2f5150f725bff8b48458c1e2a08df2c2ad91f8723ab024227d8e3c9e5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The podium was installed in 2017\nPreviously, the ceremony was held in\nthe Royal Boxanywhere else\".\nNotably, the circuit includes a tunne l. The contrast of daylight and gloom when entering/exiting the tunne l\npresents \"challenges not faced elsewhere\", as the drivers have to \"adjust their vision as they emerge from\nthe tunne l at the fastest point of the track and br ake for the chicane in the daylight.\".[73]\nThe fastest-ever qualifying lap was set by Lewis Hamilton in qualifying (Q3) for the 2019 Monaco Grand\nPrix, at a time of 1:10.166.[74]\nDuring the Grand Prix weekend, spectators crowd around the Monaco Circuit. There are a number of\ntemporary grandstands built around the circuit, mostly around the harbour area.[75] The rich and famous\nspectators often arrive on their boats and the yachts through the harbour. Balconies around Monaco become\nviewing areas for the race as well. Many hot els and residents cash in on t he bird's eye views of the race.[76]\nThe Monaco Grand Prix is organised each year by the Automobile\nClub de Monac o which also runs the Monte Carlo Rally and\npreviously ran the Junior Monaco Kart Cup.[77]\nThe Monaco Grand Prix differs in several ways from other Grands\nPrix. The practice session for the race was traditionally held on the\nThursday preceding the race instead of Friday.[78] This allows the\nstreets to be opened to the public again on Friday. From the 2022\nevent onwards the first two Formula One practice sessions will now\nbe held on Friday, bringing the running schedule for Formula One\nin line with other Grands Prix.[79] Support races will still be run on\nThursday.[80] Until the late 1990s  the race started at 3:30 p.m. local\ntime \u2013 an hour and a half later than other European Formula One\nraces. In recent years the race has fallen in line with the other\nFormula One races for the conve nience of television viewers. Also,\nearlier the event was traditionally held on the week of Ascension\nDay. For many years, the numbers of cars admitted to Grands Prix\nwas at the discretion of the race organisers \u2013 Monaco had the\nsmallest grids, ostensibly because of its narrow and twisting\ntrack.[81] Only 18 cars were permitted to start the 1975 Monaco\nGrand Prix, compared to 23 to 26 cars at all other rounds  that\nyear.[82]\nThe erecting of the circuit takes six weeks, and the removal after the race takes three weeks.[83] Until 2017,\nthere was no proper podium at the race. Instead, a section of the track was closed after the race to act as\nparc ferm\u00e9, a place where the cars are held for official inspection. The first three drivers in the race left their\ncars there and walked directly to the royal box where the 'podium' ceremony was held, which was\nconsidered a custom for the race.[84] The trophies were handed out before the national anthems for the\nwinning dr iver and team are played, as oppos ed to other Grands Prix where the anthems are played first.[85]Viewing areas\nOrganization", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2938, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d68b351c-1352-4930-8e9b-5e484c17e974": {"__data__": {"id_": "d68b351c-1352-4930-8e9b-5e484c17e974", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Monaco_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "576f3129-d22c-4a40-9b07-a31bd22440a8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Monaco_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "68d5d4f29cf48286e08dee3db692d2a1ce3c3d374578e79d70ea46f7e6662408", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Monaco Grand Prix is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile\nraces in the world alongs ide the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.[86][87] These three races\nare considered to form a Triple Crown of the three most famous motor races in the world. As of 2023,\nGraham Hill is the only driver to have won the Triple Crown, by winning all three races. The practice\nsession for Monaco overlaps with that for the Indianapolis 500, and the races themselves sometimes clash.\nAs the two races take place on oppos ite sides of the Atlantic Ocean and form part of different\nchampionships, it is difficult for one driver to compete effectively in both during his career. Juan Pablo\nMontoya and Fernando Alonso are the only active drivers to have won two of the three events.[88][89]\nIn awarding its first gold medal for motorsport to Prince Rainier III, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de\nl'Automobile (FIA) characterised the Monaco Grand Prix as contributing \"an exceptional location of\nglamour and prestige\" to motorsport.[9] The Grand Prix has been run unde r the patronage of three\ngenerations of Monaco's royal family: Louis II, Rainier III and Albert II, all of whom have taken a close\ninterest in the race. A large part of the principality's income comes from tourists attracted by the warm\nclimate and the famous casino, but it is also a tax haven and is home to many millionaires, including several\nFormula One drivers.[90]\nMonaco has produc ed four native Formula One drivers\u2014Louis Chiron, Andr\u00e9 Testut, Olivier Beretta, and\nCharles Leclerc[91]\u2014but  its tax status has made it home to many drivers over the years, including Gilles\nVilleneuve and Ayrton Senna. Of the 2006  Formula One contenders, several have property in the\nprincipality, including Jenson Button and David Coulthard, who was part owner of a hotel there.[92]\nBecause of the small size of the principality and the location of the circuit, drivers whose races end early\ncan usually get back to their apartments in minutes. Ayrton Senna famously retired to his apartment after\ncrashing out of the lead of the 1988 race.[93] In the 2006 race, after retiring due to a mechanical failure\nwhile in second pl ace, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n retired to his yacht, which was parked in the harbour.[94]\nThe Grand Prix attracts big-name celebrities each year who come to experience the glamour and prestige of\nthe event. Big parties are held in the nightclubs on the Grand Prix weekend, and the Port Hercule fills up\nwith party-goers joining in the celebrations.[95]\nCriticism from drivers and commentators\nIn the 21st century, several commentators and F1 drivers have called the Grand Prix the most boring race of\nall circuits, both to drive and to watch as a spectator. Criticism has been directed towards how few overtake\nattempts are performed, as well as how frequently the driver who sets the pole position wins.[96][97]\nFernando Alonso has said that the race is \"the most boring race ever,\" and Lewis Hamilton stated that the\n2022 G rand Prix \"wasn't really racing.\"[98][99]\nDrivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current
