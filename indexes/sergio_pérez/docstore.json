This brought  the session\nto a close and P\u00e9rez's teammate Max Verstappen was unable to set a time after aborting his first lap in Q3. In the race, P\u00e9rez was overtaken by Verstappen when he\npitted on lap 21. He briefly regained the lead on lap 46 when Verstappen pitted for mediums but eventually conceded the lead to his teammate who would go on to\nwin the race.[131]\nAfter a string of bad luck and errors saw P\u00e9rez neither make Q3 for the next five races nor the podium for the next three, P\u00e9rez qualified second behind Verstappen\nfor the sprint race in Austria. He tussled with Verstappen for the lead but eventually finished second. In the race, he finished in third place from his grid position of\nfifteenth.[132]\nIn Hunga ry, P\u00e9rez finished third after qualifying in ninth and also got  Driver of the Day.[133][134]\nP\u00e9rez qualified third in Belgium, a few tenths behind Charles Leclerc but started second due to teammate Verstappen's gearbox penalty. He qualified eighth for the\nSprint Shootout after not getting to complete a final lap, and due to damage after contact with Hamilton could not finish the sprint. In the race he overtook Leclerc\non the first lap. He later lost the lead to Verstappen and finished second.[135]\nAfter narrowly missing out on the podium in the Netherlands,[136] in Italy he qualified fifth despite an engine issue in FP3. He started behind both Ferraris,\nVerstappen and Russell. In the race he started on medium tyres, overtook Russell, and later pitted for hard tyres. He narrowly missed out on unde rcutting both\nFerraris but overtook t hem anyway, finishing second.[137]\nAfter finishing 8th in Singapore and retiring in Japan two times in one race which allowed Lewis Hamilton to close up to him in the fight for second in the\nchampionship, P\u00e9rez entered Qatar needing to outscore teammate Verstappen by 32 points to keep his title hope s alive but he qualified 13th for the main race and\n8th for the sprint. In the sprint he was making progress when he got collected by Esteban Ocon after the Alpine driver collided with Nico H\u00fclkenberg and spun\ninto P\u00e9rez. The damage ended his race which knoc ked him out of title contention confirming Verstappen as the 2023 World Champion. He finished 10th in the\nmain race after multiple penalties.[138] In the United States Grand Prix, he finished in 4th place. In the next race, the Mexican Grand Prix, he collided with Leclerc\nwhile trying to ove rtake him around t he outside, forcing hi m to retire from his hom e race on the first lap.\nP\u00e9rez started the 2024 season with a second-place finish in the Bahrain Grand Prix, and another second-place finish at the\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix.
