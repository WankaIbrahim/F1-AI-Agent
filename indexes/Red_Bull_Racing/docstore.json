Christian Horner was\ninstalled as the new team boss and lined up David Coulthard and Christian Klien to drive for the team. The\nteam operated unde r a British racing licence from 2005  to 2006 .[16]\nRed Bull Racing was not the start of Red Bull's involvement in Formula One, as they sponsored Sauber\nfrom 1995 to 2004. After buying a Formula One team of its own, Red Bull ended its long-term partnership\nwith the Swiss team. Red Bull also runs a young drivers programme, Red Bull Junior Team, whereby Red\nBull spons ors promising young drivers. High-profile drivers who have received this backing include\nEnrique Bernoldi, Christian Klien, Patrick Friesacher, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Scott Speed. Red Bull also\nspons ors many drivers and teams competing in the Formula 2 Championship, Formula One's \"feeder\"\nseries.\nRed Bull's owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, reportedly tried to recruit\nformer Formula One driver and BMW Motorsport chief (and fellow\nAustrian) Gerhard Berger to help guide the team through its debut\nseason. However, this was never realised. For 2005 , the chassis was\nchristened the RB1. Red Bull Racing used Cosworth engines in its\nmaiden year due to the ease of continuing with the engine Jaguar\nRacing us ed.\nFormer McLaren driver David Coulthard led the team. Coulthard\nwas chosen for his experience, considered ideal to help lead the\nfledgling team. For the second car, Red Bull shared the drive between two of its young sponsored drivers:\nChristian Klien, who had driven for Jaguar in 2004  and 2004 F3000  champion Vitantonio Liuzzi. At first, it\nwas annou nced that Klien and Liuzzi would swap driving duty every four races, but by the end of the\nseason, L iuzzi had appeared onl y four times.Cosworth engines (2005)\n2005 season", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2735, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46099aa9-1c82-4e14-8c18-2bee18295955": {"__data__": {"id_": "46099aa9-1c82-4e14-8c18-2bee18295955", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Red_Bull_Racing.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42eee999-7a8a-4d1d-85d0-58b9187daf7d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Red_Bull_Racing.pdf"}, "hash": "4d8cd7fcdc35579d23984b728a72aed0c87db8f654695c324ead4bedd679272a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Coulthard driving the RB2 at the 2006\nGerman Grand PrixRed Bull's first year in Formula One was a massive success compared to its predecessors, Jaguar Racing.\nThey were 6th in the Constructors' Championship for most of the season, only beaten by the fast-improving\nBAR Hondas at the end of the season. In a single season, they amassed more points than Jaguar had in\n2003  and 2004 . Coulthard, after a poor 2003 and 2004 with McLaren, was a revelation for the team while\nKlien showed that he had vastly improved from 2004.  Overall they scored 34 points; 24 for Coulthard, 9\nfor Klien and 1 for Liuzzi. Red Bull Racing was a consistent point and occasional podium challenger for\nmost of their debut season.\nAmerican driver Scott Speed, who rose through t he ranks in the American equivalent of the Red Bull Junior\nTeam, Red Bull Driver Search, was Red Bull Racing's third driver in 2005 for the Canadian and United\nStates Grands Prix. Speed was attractive to Red Bull Racing because of his American nationality which\nwould raise the profile of both Red Bull and Formula One in America, a market where the sport has\ntraditionally struggled to make an impact.\nOn 23 April 2005, the team announc ed a deal to utilise customer Ferrari engines in 2006 . This coincided\nwith a rule change mandating the use of V8 engines, making it likely that both Red Bull Racing and Ferrari\nwould use the same specification engine. Red Bull Racing continued to use Michelin tyres, rather than the\nBridgestones used by F errari.\nOn 8 November 2005, Red Bull Racing hired Adrian Newey,\nthe highly successful McLaren technical director.[17]\nOn 15 December 2005, the team's second car, the Red Bull\nRB2, hit the track for the first time. David Coulthard\ncompleted a handful of laps of the Silverstone circuit in\nEngland, and declared the new car was a \"sexy looking\nthing\".[18] In early testing Red Bull was plagued with cooling\nproblems and ove rheating of  car compone nts.[19]\nAt the opening race of the 2006 season in Bahrain, Christian\nKlien qualified eighth (ahead of Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault\nand both BMWs). Coulthard had problems when he flat-\nspotted a tyre fighting with Nick Heidfeld, and finished 10th; the cooling problems returned when his\nFerrari engine expired on the slowing down lap, forcing a grid penalty for the following race. In Malaysia,\nCoulthard made up several places from the back of the grid but was forced to retire with hydraulic\nproblems, while Klien had an opening lap incident with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n and after pitting for repairs also\nretired with hydraulic failure. Coulthard got a point in Australia after Scott Speed was penalised for passing\nhim unde r the yellow flags. The following races were marred with retirements and lowly finishes.\nCoulthard finished 3rd at Monaco, the team's first podium finish. Team boss Christian Horner said before\nthe race that if one of his cars were to finish on the podium, he would jump into a swimming pool at the\ntrack naked. He ended up jumping into the pool wearing only a red cape.

The performance hike the team experienced at the Catalan track left both\ndrivers and team optimistic about their future results, with reliability troubles being as much a focus as the\nincrease of their already competitive pace.\nRed Bull Racing further strengthened their technical department by hiring Geoff Willis as Technical\nDirector on 17 J uly 2007.[23]\nAfter this, the drivers seemed to have a stroke of good luck during the unpredictable and exciting 2007\nEuropean Grand Prix in which Webber finished 3rd, his second career podium.

STR operates as a separate team, but the two share certain technical resources. In 2006, STR used\na chassis based on the 2005 Red Bull Racing Red Bull RB1 chassis, originally designed by Jaguar Racing,\nand Minardi's contracted supply of rev-limited V10 Cosworth engines. It was widely speculated that the\n2007 chassis for both teams would be essentially the same Adrian Newey design, although Red Bull was\ncareful to announc e that the \"STR2 will be built by Red Bull Technology, and Toro Rosso will fully own\nthe intellectual rights of the car\".[119] Formula One teams are not allowed to use another team's chassis.\nSTR has been used as a 'B' team for Red Bull Racing, allowing the company to work with more drivers. As\nof the 2010 season this arrangement was outlawed, and the STR5 is the first Toro Rosso car designed and\nbuilt in-house.[120] In 2006, Red Bull Racing driver Vitantonio Liuzzi was given a full-time seat with STR\nalongside another Red Bull spons ored driver, Scott Speed. Liuzzi retained his seat in STR for the 2007\nseason. Sebastian Vettel replaced Speed in the middle of the 2007 season, and S\u00e9bastien Bourdais replaced\nLiuzzi at STR for the 2008  season. Against expectation, T oro Rosso performed well during the 2008 s eason\nand Sebastian Vettel won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. This meant that STR took their first win before Red\nBull Racing, and helped to secure Vettel a drive with Red Bull Racing for 2009 when he also took that\nteam's first win.\nFor 2020 , the team was rebranded as Scuderia AlphaTauri to promote Red Bull's fashion brand of the same\nname.[121] Scuderia AlphaTauri achieved their maiden Grand Prix win unde r the new name at the 2020\nItalian Grand Prix.
