The first\nnational race of Belgium was held in 1925 at\nthe Spa region's race course, an area of the\ncountry that had been associated with motor\nsport since the very early years of racing. To\naccommodate Grand Prix motor racing, the\nCircuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course\nwas built in 1921 but until 1924 it was used\nonly for motorcycle racing. After the 1923\nsuccess of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in\nFrance, the Spa 24 Hours, a similar 24-hour\nendurance race, was run at the Spa track.\nSince its inception, Spa-Francorchamps has\nbeen know n for its unpredictable weather. At\none stage in its history it had rained at the\nBelgian Grand Prix for twenty years in a row.\nFrequently drivers confront a part of the\ncourse that is clear and bright while another\nstretch is rainy and slippery.\nThe Belgian Grand Prix was designated the\nEuropean Grand Prix six times between 1925\nand 1973,  when this title was an honor ary\ndesignation given each year to one Grand Prix\nrace in Europe. It is one of the most popul ar\nraces on the Formula One calendar, due to the\nscenic and historical Spa-Francorchamps\ncircuit being a favourite of drivers and fans.\nHistory\nSpa-Francorchamps (pre-WWII) and Bois de la Cambre", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2020, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "768f07a4-8029-4e25-9522-917e04b44887": {"__data__": {"id_": "768f07a4-8029-4e25-9522-917e04b44887", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eff61446-f026-4799-bab8-23ba39876ba9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "b18b17f97a8229a50fe20995d5e797b25ab0b107c64e1966d41d4242b2fc11ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aadb74c4-4dcf-41e9-b1bf-32260f3bf650", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a6457cd897e486adfc52cc2dfb3e8a6cdf50dcd279bfde7cfc2b824b5c20900", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Antonio Ascari, winner Belgian Grand\nPrix, 1925In 1925, the first Belgian Grand Prix was held at the very fast, 9-\nmile Spa-Francorchamps circuit located in the Ardennes region of\neastern Belgium, about half an hour from Liege. This race was won\nby the Italian works Alfa driver Antonio Ascari, whose son Alberto\nwould win the race in 1952 and 1953. After winning the Belgian\nrace, Antonio Ascari was killed in his next race at the 1925 French\nGrand Prix. The Grand Prix did not come back until 1930, and the\ncircuit had been modified, bypa ssing the Malmedy chicane. The\nrace was won by Louis Chiron, and in 1931, the Grand Prix had\nbecome something of an endurance race, with Briton William\nGrover-Williams and Caberto Conelli winning. 1933 was won by\nTazio Nuvolari, and 1935 was won by Rudolf Caracciola in a Mercedes, by which time the circuit had re-\ninstalled the Malmedy Chicane. The 1939 race saw the birth of the Raidillon corner; it was a bypa ss of the\nAncienne Douane section. In contrast to popul ar belief, only the small kink to the left at the bottom of the\ndrop is named Eau Rouge , which directly leads into Raidillon, a very long right uphill corner;[5] and the\ntricky left blind corner at the top has no name. The conditions were dreadful, and the race was marred by the\ndeath of British driver Richard \"Dick\" Seaman while leading the race. Going into Clubhous e corner,\nSeaman was pushing hard; he skidded off the rain-soaked road, hit a tree and his Mercedes caught fire.\nSeaman received life-threatening burns, and he succumbed to his injuries later in hospital. The race was won\nby Seaman's teammate Hermann Lang. World War II broke out, and the Belgian Grand Prix did not return\nuntil June 1946, when the 2 to 4.5 litres race at the Bois de la Cambre public park in the Belgian capital of\nBrussels was won by F renchman Eug\u00e8ne Chaboud  in a Delage.\nSpa was modified to make it even faster, shortening it to 8.7 miles (14.1 km). All of the slow corners were\ntaken out \u2013 the Stavelot hairpin was bypa ssed and made into a fast banked corner and the Malmedy chicane\nwas also bypa ssed. At this time, every corner except La Source was ultra-high speed. Spa over this time\nbecame know n as one of the most extreme, challenging and fearsome circuits in motorsports history. 1950\nsaw the introduc tion of the Formula One World Championship; the race was dominated by the Alfa Romeos\nof Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio and Italian Nino Farina. Their closest challenger, Alberto Ascari, ran into\nfuel problems and fell back. The race was won by Fangio, and Farina won the next year's race in his works\nAlfa after Fangio droppe d back with hub problems. 1953 saw Ascari dominate in his Ferrari while the\nMaseratis fell apart. Fangio crashed and Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez had a steering failure and stoppe d out near\nthe banked Stavelot corner. 1955 saw Mercedes dominate, Fangio and his British teammate Stirling Moss\nled the race distance. Moss followed Fangio closely for most of the race, the Argentine took victory as he\nhad the year before in a Maserati. 1956 saw a wet race, with Moss in a Maserati lead, and Fangio, now\ndriving for Ferrari, made a bad start and droppe d to fifth at the start, although he got up to second behind\nMoss. The track was drying, and Moss lost a wheel at Raidillon corner. He did not hit anything and went\nback to take over his teammate Cesare Perdisa's car and was able to finish 3rd.

The layout was still the same as\nbefore, and the extremely small, almost non-existent margin for error as described before had been realised\nvery quickly. The circuit was extremely challenging, mainly because each corner on the circuit was so fast,\nand also because of the circuit's long length in addition to the fact that it was almost exclusively made up of\nfast corners and straights. The circuit was very fast, and each corner had to be taken correctly to maintain\nspeed through the next one. Lifting off or taking the wrong racing line would result in several seconds being\nlost. Spa was located in a region where the weather was unpredictable; in many races there, while one part\nof the track was dry and had sunshine, another at the same time was soaking wet and it was raining there.\nThere were no radios in the days of the old Spa circuit, so drivers had no idea of circuit conditions and could\nencounter rain without warning, where there had been none  on the previous lap. The nature of the circuit\nmeant that cars spinning off could hit telegraph poles, houses, stone walls, embankments or trees. Many\ndrivers were killed or seriously injured at Spa during the 1950s  in all disciplines of motorsport that competed\nthere.\n1958 was won by Briton Tony Brooks, driving a Vanwall, from his teammate Stirling Moss. The race was\nnot run in 1959, but 1960 was to be one of the darkest weekends in the history of Formula One. Grand Prix\nracing had moved forward to a new kind of car design \u2013 new British independent teams such as Coope r and\nLotus had pioneered the rear-mid-engined car, much like the Auto Union Grand Prix cars of the 1930s .\nThese cars were considerably lighter, faster and easier to drive than their front-engined predecessors, and it\nbecame obvious that rear-mid-engined cars were the way to go in purpose-built automobile racing. But this\nnew type of cars had not been driven at Spa before, so no one knew how they would perform there. The\nhigh-speed bends at Spa were now much faster with these new cars \u2013 and in those days, the cars or circuits\nfor that matter had absolutely no safety features of any kind. The cylinder-shaped bodyw ork was made of\nvery thin highly flammable magnesium or fibreglass, and the tube-frame chassis of that day offered little\ncrash resistance (as oppos ed to a modern-day monoc oque , pioneered by Lotus only a few years later). Cars\nwere not crash-tested and lacked roll bars (made mandatory in 1961)  and fire extinguishers. Although\ndrivers did wear helmets, they were made of weak and lightweight material and not scientifically designed\nor tested. Drivers in those days did not wear seatbelts \u2013 they found it preferable to be thrown from a car that\nmight be on fire to reduce the chance of injury or death.\nDuring practice, Stirling Moss, now driving a privately entered Lotus, had a wheel come off his car and he\ncrashed heavily at the Burnenville right-hander. Moss, who was considered one of the best racing drivers in\nthe world at the time, was thrown out of his car and landed unconscious in the middle of the track. The\nEnglishman broke both legs, three vertebrae, several ribs and had many cuts and abrasions; he survived but\ndid not race for most of that year. Briton Mike Taylor, also driving a Lotus, suffered a steering failure and\ncrashed into trees next to the track near Stavelot. Taylor then was trapped in the car for some time with\nserious head and neck injuries. The accident ended his racing career; he later successfully sued Lotus\nfounde r Colin Chapman in British court for sale of faulty machinery. The race itself, however, was to be\neven more disastrous. On lap 17, B riton Chris Bristow, driving a Coope r, was fighting for sixth with Belgian\nWilly Mairesse.

Australian Jack Brabham won the\nrace, and British future great Jim Clark scored his first Formula One points by finishing 5th \u2013 but Clark, like\na number of other drivers, developed an intense dislike for the circuit after he had to swerve at extreme\nspeeds to avoid running over Bristow's headless body .

This year saw another rain-soaked race: on the first lap, as\nthe field reached the far side of the circuit, a heavy rainstorm caused seven drivers to hydroplane off at\nBurnenville. Briton Jackie Stewart had a high speed accident at the Masta Kink, where he went through a\nwoodc utter's hut, hit a telegraph pol e, and dr oppe d into a much lower part of the circuit where the car landed\nupside down. The BRM Stewart was driving had bent itself over his legs, so he could not get out by himself\nand the Scot ended up being stuck in his car for nearly 30 minutes. The fuel tanks, which were bags located\ninside the car that flanked the driver, had ruptured and were soaking him with flammable fuel, and he also\nhad broken ribs and collarbone . Stewart's BRM teammate Graham Hill and Bob Bondur ant, both of whom\nhad gone  off near Stewart, came to help. Because of the absence of safety precautions in those days, they\nhad to borrow spanners from a nearby spectator, and the two drivers got Stewart out. There were other bad\naccidents on the circuit; some of the cars were hanging off 30-feet-high ledges. Stewart's crash at this race\ninspired his subsequent crusade for safety at racetracks. There was so much water on the track that the\nClimax engine in Clark's Lotus was flooded and failed.

Average lap speeds were past 150 mph (240 km/h), but\nthe circuit still had virtually no safety features and as a result the race over the years was becoming less and\nless popul ar with the drivers. The Grand Prix was scheduled for 8 June 1969 as part of that year's season.\nWhen Jackie Stewart visited the circuit on behalf of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association he demanded many\nimprovements to safety barriers and road surfaces, in order to make the track safe for racing.[7] When the\ntrack owners did not want to pay for the safety improvements, the British, French and Italian teams\nwithdrew from the event, and it was cancelled in early April. The exclusion of the Belgian Grand Prix that\nyear was not popul ar with the press, particularly British journalist Denis Jenkinson.[8] One last race was held\nthere in 1970 with barriers and a temporary chicane at the fast Malmedy corner installed at the circuit, but\neven this did not stop the cars still averaging over 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) around the 8.7 miles\n(14.0 km) track. The race was won by Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a BRM with New Zealander Chris\nAmon finishing 1.1 seconds behind in a March. But Spa was still too fast and too dangerous, and in 1971\nthe Belgian Grand Prix was cancelled, as the track was not up to mandatory FIA-mandated safety specs that\nyear. The event was then eventually relocated.\nFollowing that decision, the Belgians decided to alternate their Grand Prix between Zolder in northern\nBelgium and a circuit at Nivelles-Baulers near Brussels. The first race at Nivelles in 1972 was won by\nEmerson Fittipaldi. Zolder hosted the race the following year and it was won by Jackie Stewart. Formula\nOne returned to Nivelles in 1974. Once again the race was won by Fittipaldi, but the circuit was unpopul ar\namong the Formula One circus and after that event the organizers were unable to sustain a Grand Prix at\nNivelles, and the track faded from the racing scene.\nThe Belgian Grand Prix would be held at Zolder a further nine times. Niki Lauda scored back-to-back\nvictories at the track in 1975 and 1976, and in 1977 Gunna r Nilsson scored his only F1 victory at Zolder.\nThe following year Mario Andretti dominated the race for Lotus, driving the 79 in its debut race. In 1979,\nJody Scheckter won the race in his Ferrari, and in 1980 Didier Pironi became a first time winner in his\nLigier.\nThe 1981  meeting was a chaotic event wrapped in the midst of the FISA\u2013FOCA war and the poor\nconditions of the Zolder circuit, including its very narrow pitlane. During Friday practice, Osella mechanic\nGiovanni Amadeo was accidentally run over in the pitlane by Argentine Carlos Reutemann. He died of his\ninjuries the day after the race. On race day, as a result of the poor conditions of Zolder and the accident on\nFriday, there was drivers' strike which caused the race to be started later than scheduled. Then, when the\nrace started after yet another delay, there was a starting-grid accident involving an Arrows mechanic:\nRiccardo Patrese stalled his Arrows on the grid, so his mechanic Dave Luckett jumped onto the circuit to try\nand start Patrese's car; however, the organizers started the race and the whole field went into motion while\nLuckett was still on the road. Next, the other Arrows driver, Italian Siegfried Stohr, hit the back of Patrese's\ncar, where Luckett was standing. Luckett was knoc ked unconscious and laid sprawled on the circuit. Then,\nwhen the field reached the pit straight again (by which time Luckett had been removed from the road,\nalthough the track still had Stohr's broken Arrows car on the circuit and the surface was littered with debris)\na number of track marshals jumped onto the tarmac and frantically waved their arms to try to make the field\nstop while waving yellow flags instead of red flags. The cars went by at full racing speeds. When they came\nback again for the third lap they voluntarily stoppe d themselves. The race was restarted and was won by\nReutemann.

Coulthard later admitted he had been at fault, due to his own inexperience.[9] Only eight drivers\nwere classified finishers (two of whom were five laps behind, one of whom was Coulthard) and Damon Hill\nsecured a victory ahead of his teammate Ralf Schumacher to record the Jordan team's first Formula One\nwin.\nSchumacher won his 52nd Grand Prix at Spa in 2001, surpassing Alain Prost's all-time record of 51 wins.\nSchumacher also won his seventh World Drivers' Championship title at Spa in 2004. There was no Belgian\nGrand Prix in 2003 because of the country's tobacco advertising laws. In 2006, the FIA announc ed the\nBelgian Grand Prix would not be on the calendar, since the local authorities would not be able to complete\nmajor repair work at Spa-Francorchamps before the September race.[10] The Belgian Grand Prix returned in\n2007, w hen Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n took pol e position and hi s third Belgian Grand Prix win in a row.Return to Spa-Francorchamps", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3990, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc6ea963-b1f1-4c5c-b28c-beec047d285a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc6ea963-b1f1-4c5c-b28c-beec047d285a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c63bdf3-b4a3-4dba-9b47-87f4254a56d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "637840dd900782f5b1ba4bf3457b18d28c7d4f9a5385f7b036dd28092f774671", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In 2008, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton survived a frantic last two laps in a late shower of rain to win the race.\nHamilton lost the lead to Ferrari's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n with an early spin but fought  back in the closing laps to\nre-take the lead with two laps to go. On a soaking track, Hamilton passed R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n, lost the lead again\nwith a spin, re-took it and then saw R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n crash. Ferrari's Felipe Massa took second leaving him eight\npoints behind Hamilton. However, the stewards decided after the race to apply a 25-second penalty,\nconsidered a drive-through penalty unde r the regulations, for Hamilton's pass on R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n after they had\ndeemed that Hamilton had cut a corner in the Bus Stop chicane. This left Hamilton in third place behind\nFerrari's Felipe Massa and BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld. The penalty cut Hamilton's lead over Massa to\njust two points with five races remaining. McLaren appealed the decision but were turned down as it is not\npermissible to appeal drive-through penalties. The stewards' decision was criticised by former world\nchampion N iki Lauda calling it \"completely wrong\" .[11]\nIn 2009, Bernie Ecclestone said in an interview that he would like the Belgian Grand Prix to rotate with a\nGrand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring, rather than the N\u00fcrburgring rotating with the Hockenheimring.[12] This\nrotation never eventualised and as of June 2020  the Belgian Grand Prix is contracted to be held through\n2022.[13]\nThe 2021 race became particularly notable for becoming the shortest Formula One World Championship\nrace in history and the only World Championship Grand Prix not to have any running unde r full green flag\nconditions in its duration with only two full completed laps completed behind the safety car before the race\nwas red-flagged on lap 3 and not restarted due to adverse weather conditions with the race classification\nbeing counted back to the end of lap 1 with Max Verstappen classified first, George Russell second and\nLewis Hamilton third, with half points being awarded.[14] The controversy surroundi ng the awarding of\npoints for this race led to Formula One and the FIA changing the points structure for shortened races ahead\nof the 2022 Formula One World Championship.[15][16] The 2022 race was won by Verstappen from 14th,\nthe second lowest position the race has been won from, after Michael Schumacher in 1995 .[17] The race's\ncontract was extended to the 2023  season.[18] In October 2023 the race's contract was extended to the 2025\nseason.[19]\nDrivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\nMichael Schumacher won the Belgian Grand Prix six times. Ayrton Senna and Lewis Hamilton won five\ntimes each, including four consecutively from 1988 to 1991 for Senna. Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n and Jim Clark won\nfour times each.
