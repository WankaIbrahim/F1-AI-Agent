He finished\nseventh overall, with two pole positions (scored at the Norisring), 5 podiums (including four rookie wins), and 187 points\noverall.\nIn December 2015, Albon partook in post-season testing with ART Grand Prix. In 2016, Albon raced for ART in the\nGP3.[17] Albon c laimed four wins and finished as runne r-up in the championship to teammate Charles Leclerc.\nIn 2017, Albon graduated to the FIA Formula 2 Championship, with ART.[18] His teammate for the season would be Nobuha ru Matsushita, who at the time was\nalso signed as a development driver for McLaren. He made his debut in Bahrain, where he started in 9th place on the starting grid for the feature race and finished\n6th. For the sprint race, Albon qualified 3rd on the grid, behind Luca Ghiotto and his teammate, Matsushita. However, mechanical problems forced Matsushita to\nstart from the pitlane promoting Albon t o second. Albon s truggled for grip for the majority of the race and finished in 7th pos ition.[19]\nAt the Spanish round  Albon placed 3rd on the provisional starting grid for the feature race. Charles Leclerc led into turn one, but found himself unde r fire from\nGhiotto and Albon after locking up. Leclerc began to pull away from Ghiotto, who began to fall into the clutches of Albon, who subsequently made a move into\nturn one and took second place from Ghiotto. Leclerc pitted on lap seven, along with Matsushita, leaving Albon with the lead of the race. Sergio Canamasas\nground to a halt on lap 10 owing to problems with the car. Despite this, he did not pull off the track to retire \u2013 instead remaining on the track and gesturing to the\nmarshals asking for a push-start. The dangerous position of the car initially brought out the virtual safety car and eventually, the safety car itself. As the race\nresumed, Leclerc and Ghiotto began to scythe through the pack. Oliver Rowland eventually pressured Albon into a mistake to take the lead of the race, although\nboth still had an impending pitstop to make. With the fresh rubbe r, Albon and Rowland were staging a comeback with both drivers challenging for the podium\ntoward the latter stages of the race, Albon later finished the race in 5th position. In the sprint race, Albon started 4th on the grid and enjoyed a well-fought  battle\nwith Leclerc for the majority of the race and after battling for several laps, Leclerc finally passed Albon for fifth place. Later in the race however Albon droppe d\nback, finishing the race in 8th pos ition.\nAt the Monaco round , Albon qualified second on the grid with a time of 1:19.321 seconds. In qualifying, the grid was separated into two Groups due to safety\nconcerns over the short and tight nature of the circuit. Albon was part of the 'Group B' qualifying and managed to gain the fastest time in that group, only\nqualifying 12 hundr edths of a second behind Leclerc who qualified in Group A. After an aborted start due to Antonio Fuoco and Sean Gelael's engines stalling on\nthe grid, Leclerc led into the first corner, followed by Albon.
