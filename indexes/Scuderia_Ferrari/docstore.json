The team's drivers for the 2024\nseason are Charles Leclerc  and Carlos Sainz Jr. The\nlatter will be replaced by Lewis Hamilton  in 2025 .\nScuderia Ferrari was founded by Enzo Ferrari  in 1929\nto enter amateur drivers in various races.[7] Ferrari\nhimself had raced in Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali\nand Alfa Rom eo cars before that date. The idea came\nabout on the night  of 16 November at a dinner in\nBologna , where Ferrari solicited financial help from\ntextile heirs Augusto  and Alfredo Caniato and wealthy\namateur racer Mario Tadini. He then gathered a team\nwhich at its peak included over forty drivers, most of\nwhom raced in various Alfa Romeo 8C cars; Ferrari\nhimself continued racing, with moderate success, until\nthe birth of his first son Dino  in 1932. The prancing\nhorse blazon first appeared at the 1932 Spa 24 Hours  in\nBelgium on a two-car team of Alfa Romeo 8C 2300\nSpiders, which finished first and second.\nIn 1933, Alfa Romeo experienced economic difficulties and\nwithdrew its team from racing. From then, the Scuderia Ferrari\nbecame the acting racing team of Alfa Romeo when the factory\nreleased to the Scud eria the up to date Monoposto  Tipo B racers.\nIn 1935, Enzo Ferrari and Luigi Bazzi built the Alfa Romeo\nBimotore , the first car to wear a Ferrari badge on the radiator\ncowl. Ferrari managed numerous established drivers (notably\nTazio Nuvolari , Giuseppe Campari , Achille Varzi, and Louis\nChiron ) and several talented rookies (Mario Tadini, Guy Moll ,\nCarlo Maria Pintacuda , and Antonio Brivio ) from his\nheadquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste, Modena, Italy, until 1938,\nat which point Alfa Romeo made him the manager of the factory\nracing division, Alfa Corse . Alfa Romeo had bought the shares of\nthe Scuderia Ferrari in 1937 and transferred, from 1 January\n1938,[8] the official racing  activity to Alfa Corse  whose new\nbuildings were being erected next to the Alfa factory at Portello,\nMilan .

After Alberto\nAscari  and the Marchese Lotario Rangoni Machiavelli di Modena\ndrove them in the 1940 Mille Miglia , World War II put a\ntemporary end to racing and the 815s saw no more competition.\nFerrari continued to manufacture machine tools (specifically\noleodynamic grinding machines).

For many , Ferrari and Formula One racing  have become inseparable, being the only team to have\ncompeted in every season since the world championship began.[16]\nFerrari produces engines for its own Formula One cars and has supplied engines to other teams. Ferrari\nhas previously supplied engines to Minardi  (1991), Scuderia Italia (1992\u20131993), Sauber  (1997\u20132005 with\nengines badged as Petronas , and 2010 \u20132025), Prost  (2001, badged Acer ), Red Bull Racing  (2006), Spyker\n(2007), Scuderia Toro Rosso  (2007\u20132013, 2016), Force India  (2008), and Marussia  (2014\u20132015). When\nregulations changed  in 2014, Cosworth decided not to make the new V6 turbo engines. Marussia,\nCosworth's only team at the time, signed a multi-year deal with Ferrari, beginning in 2014. For the 2024\nseason , Ferrari supplies the Haas F1 Team and Sauber Motorsport .[17]\nFerrari did not enter the first-ever race of the championship, the 1950 British Grand Prix, due to a dispute\nwith the organisers over \"start money\". In the 1960s, Ferrari withdrew from  several races in strike\nactions. In 1987, Ferrari considered abandoning Formula One for the Ameri can IndyCar series. This\nthreat was used as a bargaining tool with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobi le (FIA), and Enzo\nFerrari offered to cancel the IndyCar Project and commit to Formula One on the condition that the\ntechnical regulations were not changed to exclude V12 engines. The FIA agreed to this, and the IndyCar\nproject was shelved, although a car, the Ferrari 637, had already been constructed. In 2009, it had\nemer ged that Ferrari had an FIA-sanctioned veto on the technical regulations.[18]Identity\nFormula One\nEngine supply\nRelationship with governing body\nTeam orders controversies", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2702, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "346941d8-c956-47cc-a060-58514fc8f4b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "346941d8-c956-47cc-a060-58514fc8f4b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Scuderia_Ferrari.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e806540-950e-42b0-ad59-025914261678", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Scuderia_Ferrari.pdf"}, "hash": "a5fd799f31499cdc2cb2ada506da0a172dd4bdd701b9e421df730287506aef5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Team orders have proven controversial at several points in Ferrari's history . At the 1982 San Marino\nGrand Prix, the two Ferraris were leading with Gilles Villeneuve  ahead of Didier Pironi. The team\nshowed the slow sign to its drivers, and, as per a pre-race agreement, the driver  leading at that point was\nexpected to take the win of the Grand Prix. Villeneuve slowed and expected that Pironi would follow; the\nlatter did not and instead passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve was angered by what he saw as a betrayal by his\nteammate and, at one point, had even refused to go onto the podium.[19] This feud is often considered to\nhave been a contribu tory factor to his fatal accident in qualifying at the next race, the 1982 Belgian Grand\nPrix.[20][21]\nAt the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, after having starte d from pole position and leading the first 70 laps,\nRubens Barrichello  was instructed to let Ferrari teammate Michael Schumache r pass him, a move that\nproved to be unpopular among many Formula One fans and the FIA, the sport's governing body .[22][23]\nFollowing this incident and others in which team orders were used, such as McLaren 's use of them at the\n1997 European Grand Prix and at the 1998 Australian Grand Prix, and Jordan Grand Prix's at the 1998\nBelgian Grand Prix, team orders in Formula One were officially banned ahead of the 2003\nseason.[24][25][26]\nOn lap 49 of the 2010 German Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso  went past Felipe Massa  for the race lead,\nafter Ferrari had informed Massa that Alonso was \"faster than him\". This communication has widely been\ninterpreted as a team order from Ferrari. Alonso won the race, with Massa finishing second and Sebastian\nVettel taking the final place on the podium.[27] Ferrari were fined the maximum penalty available to the\nstewards, $100,000,  for breach of regulations and for \"bringing the sport into disrepute\" as per \"Article\n151c' of the International Sporting Code \". Ferrari said they would not contest the fine. The team were\nreferred to the FIA World Motor Sport Council , where they upheld the stewards' view but did not take any\nfurther action.[28][29] The ban on team orders was subsequently lifted for the 2011 season.[30]\nThe Ferrar i Formula One team was resistant to the commercial sponsorship  for many years and it was not\nuntil 1977  that the cars began to feature the logo of the Fiat group  (which had been the owners of the\nFerrari company since 1969 ). Until the 1980s, the only other companies whose logos appeared on\nFerrari's Formula One cars were techni cal partners, such as Magneti Marelli , Brembo , and Agip . At the\nend of the 1996  season, Philip Morris International  through its brand Marlboro  withdrew its sponsorship\nagreement with McLaren  after 22 years (since the 1974  season) to become the title sponsor of Ferrari,\nresulting to the change of the official team's name to Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro from the beginning of the\n1997  season until the 2011 European Grand Prix. Marlboro had already been Ferrari's minor sponsor\nsince the 1984  season and increased to the team's major sponsorship in the 1993  season.\nAlongside Jordan Grand Prix, the team was required to run non-toba cco liveries in United States Grand\nPrix in the 2000s due to United States Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement  requirements, as Phillip\nMorris was sponsoring Team Penske  at the time; a clause in the settlement allowed each tobacco\ncompany to sponsor only one sporting entity .[31] In September 2005 , Ferrari signed an extension of the\narrangement until 2011 at a time when  advertising of tobacco sponsorship had become illegal in the\nEuropean Union, and other major teams  had withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies (e.g.\nMcLaren had ended its eight-year relationship with West).

Ford decided to enter endurance racing pouring unprecedented\namounts of money in the development of a racing department in England with the objective to beat\nFerrari in this category of races. The Ford GT40  was born and developed in the years following that\ninitiative. After a few years, Ford entered also the Formula One cham pionship. No European\nmanufacturer was able to compete with this level of investment at the time, and Ford engines dominated\nFormula One racing for over a decade. Moreover , the advent of the American  carmaker brought along\nmunificent sponsors hips from American tobacco and oil companies, in addition to a bigger level of media\ncoverage to the sport. Ferrari was able to prevail in the 1964 and 1965 seasons both in the championship\nand at the 24 Hours  of Le Mans but had to concede Ford the victory in the 1966 championship and Le\nMans race, when the 7-litre GT40 had a dominant season.\nFerrari 312 PB \nFerrari 333 SP\nIn 1967, the last where Ford and Ferrari could battle on the tarmac, saw Ferrari taking the championship\nbut losing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. This last race was really controv ersial as the race timing\ncompletely disappeared for some hours during nighttime before reappearing with altered results. This and\nother controversial aspects of the race were recounted by the late Mauro Forghieri , famously quoting a\ndialogue with Mr Finance, then in charge of organising the Le Mans race. A change of rules denying the\nparticipation to prototype cars for the 1968 season forced Ferrari out from the championship and in this\nway the Ferrari vs. Ford battle in endurance racing met its end. The 1970s was the last decade Ferrari\nentered as a works effort in sports car racing. After an uninspired performance in the 1973  season, Enzo\nFerrari  stopped all develop ment of sports cars in prototype and grand touring (GT) racing at the end of\nthe year to concentra te on Formula One. This choice paid off and Ferrari was able to contend the Formula\nOne title already from the 1974  season and then went on to win several titles in the following years. After\nFerrari withdrawal from the WSC, the series soon saw a decline in the level of competition and reduced\nalmost to a one-contender show until the 1987 season, when several manufacturers entered the\nchampionship again. Since the 1985 season, the championship was declassed to a team one and there was\nnot a largely participated world manufacturer title for sportscars until the inception of the FIA World\nEndurance Championship  (WEC). Ferrari cars were raced in a range of classes, such as GT racing by\nother entrants, but not by the factory Scuderia Ferrari team. In the 1990s, Ferrari returned to sports\nprototypes as a constructor with the Ferrari 333 SP with success, although Scuderia Ferrari itself never\nraced this car .\nFrom 2006, Ferrari returned to GT car racing with a factory effort Ferra ri Competizioni GT, in\npartnership with racing teams, such as AF Corse, Kessel Racing , and Risi Competizione , among others.\nWith facto ry suppor t, these teams achieved great success in major international GT2 and GTE Pro/GTLM", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3488, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc109855-7191-4f82-8228-7024c6575ed4": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc109855-7191-4f82-8228-7024c6575ed4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Scuderia_Ferrari.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "237e93cb-88ea-4571-9f1a-01463f266119", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Scuderia_Ferrari.pdf"}, "hash": "cc315193bd26f49804c667d32cd9704f7bad4eacc02519ff62f33d1e97d0f18b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "#51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE,\n2018 6 Hours of Silverstone\nFerrari 499Pcompetitions.

It also took two\ndrivers' titles in 2006 and 2008 in the same series. Following the\ndemise of the GT Championship and the creation of a new world\nchampionship series for endurance racing by the FIA, Ferrari/AF\nCorse continued to enjoy much success in GT racing. Of the ten\nGT manufacturers' championships contested from the introduction\nof the WEC championship in 2012, Ferrari won seven editions\n(2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2021, and 2022). Almost the same\nhappened with the GT drivers' title, which had been awarded since the 2013  season, with Ferrari/AF\nCorse winning five out of nine editions (2013, 2014, 2017, 2021, and 2022). To this tally, AF Corse added\nfour out of six LMGTE PRO team trophies. Several other trophies were won also in the LMGTE\nPRO/AM class in the WEC. Other victories were also achieved in international and national\nchampionships both in GT2/LmGTE and GT3 classes all over the world. Among the victories in\nprestigious racing events are the two GT2 class wins scored at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2008 and 2009\nby Risi Competizione and the four GTE  Pro class wins scored by AF Corse at the same event: in 2012\nand 2014 with the Ferrari 458 GT2 driven by Gianmaria Bruni , Giancarlo Fisichella , and Toni Vilander ;\nin 2019 with the Ferrari 488 GTE  Ferra ri 488 GTE driven by Alessandro Pier Guidi , James Calado, and\nDaniel Serra; and in 2021 with the same car driven by Pier Guidi, Calado, and C\u00f4me Ledogar. A Ferrari\n488 GT3  scored the overall win at the 2017 12 Hours of Bathurst  and the 2021 24 Hours of Spa .\nIn 2023, after a 50-year hiatus, Ferrari returned to the top class of\nendurance racing with its new Ferrari 499P, a Le Mans Hypercar\nprototype. Subseque ntly, they were able to compete for the world\ntitle and in prestigio us events, such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans,\nthe 24 Hours of Dayton a, and the 12 Hours of Sebring . The 499P\nwas managed by AF Corse and this caused a restructuring of the\nGT activities of the successful Italian team. At the 2023 24 Hours\nof Le Mans , Ferrari achieved its first Le Mans victory since 1965\nwith the No. 51 499P  driven by Alessandro Pier Guidi , James\nCalado , and Antonio Giovinazzi . In the same year, a Ferrari 296 GT3 run by Frikadelli Racing won the 24\nHours of N\u00fcrbur gring . At the 2024 24 Hours of Le Mans , Ferrari achieved its eleventh victory , recording\nconsecutive victorie s at Le Mans for the first time since 1965 with the No. 50 499P  driven by Antonio\nFuoco , Miguel Molina  and Nicklas Nielsen .
