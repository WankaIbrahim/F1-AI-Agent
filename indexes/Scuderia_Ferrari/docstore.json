The idea came\nabout on the night of 16 November at a dinner in\nBologna , where Ferrari solicited financial help from\ntextile heirs Augus to and Alfredo Caniato and wealthy\namateur racer Mario Tadini. He then gathered a team\nwhich at its peak included over forty drivers, most of\nwhom raced in various Alfa Romeo 8C cars; Ferrari\nhimself continued racing, with moderate success, until\nthe birth of his first son Dino in 1932. The prancing\nhorse blazon first appeared at the 1932 Spa 24 Hours in\nBelgium on a two-car team of Alfa Romeo 8C 2300\nSpiders, which finished first and second.\nIn 1933, Alfa Romeo experienced econom ic difficulties and\nwithdrew its team from racing. From then, the Scuderia Ferrari\nbecame the acting racing team of Alfa Romeo when the factory\nreleased to the Scuderia the up to date Monopos to Tipo B racers. In\n1935, Enzo Ferrari and Luigi Bazzi built the Alfa Romeo\nBimotore, the first car to wear a Ferrari badge on the radiator cowl.\nFerrari managed numerous established drivers (notably Tazio\nNuvolari, Giuseppe Campari, Achille Varzi, and Louis Chiron) and\nseveral talented rookies (Mario Tadini, Guy Moll, Carlo Maria\nPintacuda, and Antonio Brivio) from his headqua rters in Viale\nTrento e Trieste, Modena, Italy, until 1938, at which point Alfa\nRomeo made him the manager of the factory racing division, Alfa\nCorse. Alfa Romeo had bought  the shares of the Scuderia Ferrari in\n1937 and transferred, from 1 January 1938,[7] the official racing\nactivity to Alfa Corse whose new buildings were being erected\nnext to the Alfa factory at Portello, Milan.

In the winter of 1939\u20131940, Ferrari started\nwork on a racecar of his own, the Tipo 815 (eight cylinders, 1.5 L\ndisplacement).[8] The 815s, designed by Alberto Massimino, were\nthus the first true Ferrari cars. After Alberto Ascari and the\nMarchese Lotario Rangoni  Machiavelli di Modena drove them in\nthe 1940 Mille Miglia, World War II put a temporary end to racing\nand the 815s  saw no more competition. Ferrari continued to\nmanufacture machine tools (specifically oleodyna mic grinding\nmachines). In 1943, he moved his headqua rters to Maranello,\nwhere it was bom bed in November 1944 a nd February 1945.[9][10]\nRules for a Grand Prix World Championship had been established\nbefore the war; it took several years afterwards for the series to\nbecome active. Meanwhile, Ferrari rebuilt his works in Maranello\nand constructed the 12-cylinder, 1.5 L Tipo 125, which competed\nat several non-championship Grands Prix. The car made its debut\nat the 1948 Italian Grand Prix with Raymond Sommer and\nachieved its first win at the minor Circuito di Garda with Giuseppe\nFarina. After the four-year condition expired, the road car company\nwas called Ferrari S.p.A., while the name SEFAC (Societ\u00e0\nEsercizio Fabbriche Automobili e Corse) was used for the racing\ndepartment.[11]\nThe team was based in\nModena from its pre-war\nfoundi ng until 1943 , when\nEnzo Ferrari moved the\nteam to a new factory in\nMaranello in 1943,[12] and\nboth Scuderia Ferrari and\nFerrari's road car factory\nremain at Maranello to this\nday.

For many, Ferrari and Formula One racing have become\ninseparable, being the only team to have competed in every season\nsince the world championship began.[15]\nFerrari produc es engines for its own Formula One cars and has\nsupplied engines to other teams. Ferrari has previously supplied\nengines to Minardi (1991) , Scuderia Italia (1992\u201319 93), Sauber\n(1997\u20132005 with engines badged as Petronas, and 2010\u20132025) ,\nProst (2001, badged Acer), Red Bull Racing (2006) , Spyke r\n(2007) , Scuderia Toro Rosso (2007\u20132013, 2016) , Force India\n(2008) , and Marussia (2014\u20132015) . When regulations changed in 2014, Cosworth decided not to make the\nnew V6 turbo engines. Marussia, Cosworth's only team at the time, signed a multi-year deal with Ferrari,\nbeginning in 2014. F or the 2024 s eason, Ferrari supplies the Haas F1 Team and Sauber Motorsport.[16]\nFerrari did not enter the first-ever race of the championship, the 1950 British Grand Prix, due to a dispute\nwith the organisers over \"start money\". In the 1960s , Ferrari withdrew from several races in strike actions.\nIn 1987, F errari considered abandoni ng Formula One for the American IndyC ar series. This threat was used\nas a bargaining tool with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), and Enzo Ferrari offered to\ncancel the IndyC ar Project and commit to Formula One on the condition that the technical regulations were\nnot changed to exclude V12 engines. The FIA agreed to this, and the IndyC ar project was shelved,\nalthough a car, the Ferrari 637, had already been constructed. In 2009, it had emerged that Ferrari had an\nFIA-sanctioned veto on t he technical regulations.[17]\nTeam orders have proven controversial at several points in Ferrari's history. At the 1982 San Marino Grand\nPrix, the two Ferraris were leading with Gilles Villeneuve ahead of Didier Pironi. The team showed the\nslow sign to its drivers, and, as per a pre-race agreement, the driver leading at that point was expected to\ntake the win of the Grand Prix. Villeneuve slowed and expected that Pironi would follow; the latter did not\nand instead passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve was angered by what he saw as a betrayal by his teammate and,\nat one point, had even refused to go onto the podium.[18] This feud is often considered to have been a\ncontributory factor to his fatal accident in qua lifying at the next race, the 1982 B elgian Grand Prix.[19][20]Formula One\nEngine supply\nRelationship with governing body\nTeam orders controversies", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3089, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7638c464-3f08-4994-8049-fd5d5c11adaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "7638c464-3f08-4994-8049-fd5d5c11adaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Scuderia_Ferrari.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21aa2eaa-62db-46f7-87e6-c333f15b082a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Scuderia_Ferrari.pdf"}, "hash": "b289fb0f9766de39c94792dbe7af9db401efc926fa6df8bc089532b37a505f44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A Ferrari truck displaying Ferrari's\nsponsors in 2008At the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, after having started from pole position and leading the first 70 laps,\nRubens Barrichello was instructed to let Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher pass him, a move that\nproved to be unpopul ar among many Formula One fans and the FIA, the sport's gove rning body .[21][22]\nFollowing this incident and others in which team orders were used, such as McLaren's use of them at the\n1997 European Grand Prix and at the 1998 Australian Grand Prix, and Jordan Grand Prix's at the 1998\nBelgian Grand Prix, team orders in Formula One were officially banned ahead of the 2003\nseason.[23][24][25]\nOn lap 49 of the 2010 German Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso went past Felipe Massa for the race lead, after\nFerrari had informed Massa that Alonso was \"faster than him\". This communication has widely been\ninterpreted as a team order from Ferrari. Alonso won the race, with Massa finishing second and Sebastian\nVettel taking the final place on the podium.[26] Ferrari were fined the maximum penalty available to the\nstewards, $100,000, for breach of regulations and for \"bringing the sport into disrepute\" as per \"Article\n151c ' of the International Sporting Code\". Ferrari said they would not contest the fine. The team were\nreferred to the FIA World Motor Sport Counc il, where they uphe ld the stewards' view but did not take any\nfurther action.[27][28] The ban on t eam orders was subsequently lifted for the 2011 season.[29]\nThe Ferrari Formula One team was resistant to the commercial sponsorship for many years and it was not\nuntil 1977  that the cars began to feature the logo of the Fiat group (which had been the owners of the\nFerrari company since 1969 ). Until the 1980s , the only other companies whose logos  appeared on Ferrari's\nFormula One cars were technical partners, such as Magneti Marelli, Brembo, and Agip. At the end of the\n1996  season, Philip Morris International through its brand Marlboro withdrew its sponsorship agreement\nwith McLaren after 22 years (since the 1974  season) to become the title spons or of Ferrari, resulting to the\nchange of the official team's name to Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro from the beginning of the 1997  season until\nthe 2011 European Grand Prix. Marlboro had already been Ferrari's minor spons or since the 1984  season\nand increased to the team's major spons orship in the 1993  season.\nAlongs ide Jordan Grand Prix, the team was required to run non-\ntobacco liveries in United States Grand Prix in the 2000s  due to\nUnited States Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement requirements,\nas Phillip Morris was spons oring Team Penske at the time; a clause\nin the settlement allowed each tobacco company to sponsor only\none sporting entity.[30] In September 2005, Ferrari signed an\nextension of the arrangement until 2011 at a time when advertising\nof tobacco spons orship had become illegal in the European Union,\nand other major teams had withdrawn from relationships with\ntobacco companies (e.g. McLaren had ended its eight-year\nrelationship with West). In reporting the deal, F1 Racing magazine\njudge d it to be a black day for the sport, putting non-tobacco funde d\nteams at a disadvantage and discouraging other brands from entering a sport still associated with tobacco.\nThe magazine estimated that between 2005 and 2011, Ferrari received $1 billion from the agreement.

At the end of 1963, a conflict between Ferrari\nand Ford over the potential acquisition of the Italian manufacturer by the American giant carmaker gave\nway to the famous \"Ford vs. Ferrari war\", a sort of modern David vs. Goliath battle that changed\ninternational motorsport forever.

The Ford GT40 was born and de veloped in the years following that initiative. After a few\nyears, Ford entered also the Formula One championship. No European manufacturer was able to compete\nwith this level of investment at the time, and Ford engines dominated Formula One racing for over a\ndecade. Moreover, the advent of the American carmaker brought  along munificent sponsorships from\nAmerican tobacco and oil companies, in addition to a bigger level of media coverage to the sport. Ferrari\nwas able to prevail in the 1964 and 1965 seasons both in the championship and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans\nbut had to concede Ford the victory in the 1966 championship and Le Mans race, when the 7-litre GT40\nhad a dom inant season.\nFerrari 312 PB \nFerrari 333 SP\nIn 1967, the last where Ford and Ferrari could battle on the tarmac, saw Ferrari taking the championship but\nlosing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. This last race was really controversial as the race timing completely\ndisappeared for some hours during nighttime before reappearing with altered results. This and other\ncontroversial aspects of the race were recounted by the late Mauro Forghieri, famously quoting a dialogue\nwith Mr Finance, then in charge of organising the Le Mans race. A change of rules denying the\nparticipation to prototype cars for the 1968 season forced Ferrari out from the championship and in this way\nthe Ferrari vs. Ford battle in endurance racing met its end. The 1970s  was the last decade Ferrari entered as\na works effort in sports car racing. After an uninspired performance in the 1973  season, Enzo Ferrari\nstoppe d all development of sports cars in prototype and grand touring (GT) racing at the end of the year to\nconcentrate on Formula One. This choice paid off and Ferrari was able to contend the Formula One title\nalready from the 1974  season and then went on to win several titles in the following years. After Ferrari\nwithdrawal from the WSC, the series soon saw a decline in the level of competition and reduced almost to a\none-contender show until the 1987 season, when several manufacturers entered the championship again.\nSince the 1985 season, the championship was declassed to a team one and there was not a largely\nparticipated world manufacturer title for sportscars until the inception of the FIA World Endurance\nChampionship (WEC). Ferrari cars were raced in a range of classes, such as GT racing by other entrants,\nbut not by the factory Scuderia Ferrari team. In the 1990s , Ferrari returned to sports prototypes as a\nconstructor with the Ferrari 333 S P with success, although S cuderia Ferrari itself never raced this car.\nFrom 2006, Ferrari returned to GT car racing with a factory effort Ferrari Competizioni GT, in partnership\nwith racing teams, such as AF Corse, Kessel Racing, and Risi Competizione, among others. With factory\nsuppor t, these teams achieved great success in major international GT2 and GTE Pro/GTLM competitions.\nStarting from this same year, AF Corse won the GT2 manufacturers' title along with the team's title each\nyear it was contested in the FIA GT Championship. It also took two drivers' titles in 2006 and 2008 in the\nsame series. Following the demise of the GT Championship and the creation of a new world championship\nseries for endurance racing by t he FIA, Ferrari/AF Corse continued to enjoy m uch success in GT racing.
