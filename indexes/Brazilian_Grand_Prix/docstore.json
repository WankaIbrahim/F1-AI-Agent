Typical of\nEuropean motorsports at the time, this race was\ndone  as a test to convince the FIA if the\nInterlagos circuit and its organizers could\ncapably hold a Grand Prix. Like most major\ncircuits used for Grands Prix in Latin America\nsuch as the Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez Autodrome\nin Mexico City, Interlagos was (and still is)\nlocated in the confines of a sprawling urban\nneighbor hood in a very large city. The\nfollowing year, however, the race was first\nincluded in the official calendar, and it was\nwon by defending world champion and S\u00e3o\nPaulo native Emerson Fittipaldi. In 1974,\nFittipaldi won again in rain soaked conditions,\nand the year after, another S\u00e3o Paulo native, Carlos Pace, won the race in his Brabham, followed by\nFittipaldi. 1977 was won by Reutemann, but the drivers began complaining about Interlagos's very rough\nsurface, and the event was then relocated for a year to the new Jacarepagu\u00e1 circuit in Rio de Janeiro.\nAfter a year in Rio, the race returned to Interlagos, with new and upgraded facilities for the next two\nseasons; this race was won by Jacques Laffite to complete his and Ligier's conque st of the opening South\nAmerican rounds  in Argentina and Brazil. But the Interlagos surface was still very bumpy. The original\narrangement from 1978 onwards was to alternate the Brazilian Grand Prix between the S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio\ncircuits; the 1980 race was originally suppos ed to be held at Jacarepagu\u00e1 but parts of that circuit (which was\noriginally built on a swamp) were beginning to sink into the soft ground and the circuit disintegrated badly,\nso the 1980 Grand Prix was to be relocated to Interlagos. But by this time, the population of S\u00e3o Paulo had\nrisen from 5 to 8 million over the space of 10 years; the area surroundi ng the track was becoming\nincreasingly run-down and the circuit did not look good for Formula One, which thanks to worldwide\ntelevision expos ure was becoming something of a glamorous spectacle. Formula One was originally\nsuppos ed to come back to Interlagos for the 1981 season after the track surface there had been repaved; it\nturned out that F1 came back a year too early. The drivers were dissatisfied with the safety conditions of the\nvery bumpy 7.873 km (4.892 mi) Interlagos circuit which had not been changed after the previous year's\nimprovements. The ground- effect wing cars of that year had a tendency to bounc e up and down thanks to\nthe suction created by the cars' wing-shaped unde rbodies, and they were more stiffly suspended than\nbefore; so these fragile cars were barely tolerant of such a rough track and were very unpleasant to drive.\nThe bad surface was so rough that the bumps caused mechanical problems for some cars. Also, the barriers\nand catch-fence arrangements were not adequate enough for Formula One.

With Formula One's more glamorous image being better suited to the better-looking city of Rio de\nJaneiro, the F1 circus went back to Rio again and the circuit went on to hos t the 1980s  turbo era.\nIn 1978  the Brazilian Grand Prix moved to Jacarepagu\u00e1 in Rio de Janeiro. Argentine Carlos Reutemann\ndominated in his Ferrari, which was equipped with superior Michelin tyres. This proved to be the French\ncompany's first victory in Formula One. Reutemann was followed by home favorite Fittipaldi and\ndefending champion Niki Lauda.[1]\nAfter the emergence in 1980 of Rio de Janeiro racer Nelson Piquet, the decline of Interlagos and the\nretirement of Fittipaldi, Brazilian fans lobbied to host the Brazilian GP in Piquet's home town. The flat\nJacarepagu\u00e1 circuit, like Interlagos before it, proved to be extremely demanding: most corners were long\nand fast, some were slightly banked and the track had a very abrasive surface. Due to the FIA calendar,\nwhich invariably had the Brazilian GP at the beginning of the season thus in the Southern hemisphere\nsummer and the tropical weather of Rio, most races were held unde r very high temperatures and high\nhumidity. Due to all of those circumstances, Grands Prix at Rio were highly demanding and most drivers\nwho w on it were exhausted in the end.\nIn 1981, Carlos Reutemann disobeyed team orders to let his teammate Alan Jones by and took the victory;\nthe following year Piquet finished first and Keke Rosberg finished second but because of the FISA\u2013FOCA\nwar, Piquet and Rosberg were both disqualified for being unde rweight in post-race scrutineering, and the\nrace victory was given to third placed Alain Prost, who would go on to win at Jacarepagu\u00e1 four more times\n(thus earning the nickname \"the King of Rio\"). The race also saw Italian Riccardo Patrese retire due to\nphys ical exhaustion (a very rare occurrence in F1, but quite common at Rio). Piquet won in 1983 and 1986,\nand the 1988 race was particularly notable, as up-and-coming star Ayrton Senna started from the pit-lane in\nhis first race for McLaren; he began a furious charge that brought  him up to second behind his teammate\nProst; but he was disqualified for switching to his spare car after the parade lap had begun. The 1989  event\nwas the last race at Jacarepagu\u00e1. It was won by British driver Nigel Mansell in his Ferrari, in the first Grand\nPrix won by a car with a semi-automatic gearbox, and it also saw German Bernd Schneider and American\nEddie Cheever collide, and C heever collapsed twice after he exited his car due to exhaustion.\nS\u00e3o Paulo native Ayrton Senna's success thus far in Formula One had city officials working hard to revamp\nthe Interlagos circuit in a $15 million investment to shorten and smooth over the circuit. In 1990  the Grand\nPrix returned to a shortened Interlagos, where it has stayed since. The Interlagos circuit has created some of\nthe most exciting and memorable races in recent F1 history, and is regarded as one of the most challenging\nand exciting circuits on the F1 calendar.\nThe first race at the new Interlagos in 1990 was won by Alain Prost, who won his 40th career race (the\nmost ever at that point in time) and his sixth Brazilian Grand Prix. It wasn't a popul ar win, as the events of\nthe previous year's Japanese Grand Prix were still fresh in the minds of many Brazilians: Prost was seen as\nhaving been given the Drivers' title by FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre at Senna's expense after Senna\nwas disqualified from that race in Japan. The Brazilian, a home favorite, finished third in Brazil after\nleading much of the race but then hitting his backmarker ex-teammate Satoru Nakajima in a Tyrrell. 1991\nsaw the patriotic Senna emotionally win his first Brazilian Grand Prix.

Senna went on to win in\na McLaren from Prost's teammate Damon Hill. 1994 saw Senna, now driving for Williams, spin his\nrecalcitrant car going through Juncao late into the race. He was running in second, trying to catch German\nMichael Schumacher, who went on to win. Senna would lose his life in an accident at the San Marino\nGrand Prix later in the year. 1995 was a very controversial race that initially had race winner Schumacher\nand Briton David Coulthard's cars excluded for apparently using illegal fuel during the race, but then\nreinstated. 1996 saw Damon Hill win his first of eight races that season. 1997 saw an accident at the start\nthat involved four cars, and Canadian Jacques Villeneuve went off the course at the first corner; the race\nwas stoppe d and restarted, and Villeneuve jumped into the spare car and won the race. 1998 saw a\ncontroversy surrounding McLaren \u2013 Ferrari had protested about their braking system, and it was then\nbanned from the Brazilian Grand Prix, although it had been approved four times by FIA technical delegate\nCharlie Whiting. It didn't matter much: Finnish McLaren driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen won the race anyway. 1999\nsaw local Rubens Barrichello lead for some time until the engine in his car failed, and H akkinen won again.\nThe 2001 Grand Prix was notable for marking the explosive arrival\nof Juan Pablo Montoya onto the Formula One scene.

The 2001\nrace is also notable for two brothers, Michael and Ralf Schumacher,\nsharing a row on the starting gr id for the first time.\nParticularly memorable recent Brazilian Grands Prix include the 2003 r ace, which saw a maiden Grand Prix\nvictory, highly unexpectedly, and amidst chaotic and unusual circumstances, for Jordan's Giancarlo\nFisichella. Heavy rain before and during the race produc ed problems with tyre selection which caught out\nmany teams, which allowed the weak Minardi team to have a real chance for victory the only time ever,\nbecause they were the only team who prepared for the rainfall, but their drivers were also soon out. And\ntreacherous track conditions caused multiple drivers to spin out of the race, including then-reigning World\nChampion Michael Schumacher, ending a remarkable run of race finishes dating back to the 2001 German\nGrand Prix. Amidst this, a number of drivers, including McLaren's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n and David Coulthard,\nled the race, and, when a heavy accident involving Renault's Fernando Alonso blocked the circuit and\nbrought  out the red flag, confusion reigned. Fisichella led the race at the time, having just overtaken\nR\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n; however, it was the Finn who was declared the race winner unde r the rule that stipulated that\nthe race result in such circumstances was to be taken from the running order two laps prior to the race being\nstoppe d. This decision was overturned days later in the FIA Court of Appeal in Paris after new evidence\ncame to light which proved that Fisichella had crossed the finish line in the lead for a second time before\nAlonso's accident, and therefore was the rightful winner. The 2004 event marked the first time since the\nrace's admission to the Formula One Championship calendar that it was not one of the first three rounds  of\nthe championship season.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4211, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b344193d-a0ce-4851-be82-98399a535c47": {"__data__": {"id_": "b344193d-a0ce-4851-be82-98399a535c47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Brazilian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ac38251-db4b-4127-a5ca-9356bb1db427", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Brazilian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "fe630a16a8fe4391e0b62fd58c146c4708b56e2ed4a9c3a6f1bd46b6e1a17aa1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, the venue\nfor the Brazilian Grand Prix\nSafety car at the 2006 Brazilian Grand\nPrixFernando Alonso became the younge st ever Formula One World\nChampion at the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix, his third place\nbehind winner Juan Pablo Montoya and championship rival\nKimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n was enough to clinch the title with two races\nremaining.\nFor 2006, the Brazilian Grand Prix, as in 2004, was moved to\nthe prestigious position of hosting the final round of the season,\nin what was Michael Schumacher's first farewell to Formula\nOne, before his return for the 2010  season. Starting from 10th\nposition on the grid, Schumacher did an astonishing job on his\nlast race. He fell to 19th position on the ninth lap due to a flat\ntyre caused by a minor collision with Giancarlo Fisichella when\nthe former was trying to overtake the latter. After pitting for a\nnew tyre he returned to the race, just in front of leader Massa, so\nalmost being lapped, then passing several drivers to take the\nchequered flag in fourth place, after a dazzling passing\nmanoeuvre on Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n. His performance was not\nenough to give Schumacher his eighth trophy , as Fernando\nAlonso, who needed only one point to become World Champion\nagain, finished in second place. Brazilian Felipe Massa took pole position and led the race from start to\nfinish to get the second vi ctory of his career and to be greeted by c elebrations from his Brazilian suppor ters.\nIn the 2007 edition, Kimi Raikkone n won the race and his first and only championship, beating both\nFernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton by a  single point.\nIn March 2008, t he mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo announc ed that he had signed a new deal with Bernie Ecclestone to\ncontinue the holding of the Brazilian Grand Prix. This deal allowed the Brazilian race to be on the calendar\nuntil 2015. W ith this, Interlagos was set for major improvements in its pit and pa ddoc k facilities.[2]\nIn the final race of the 2008 season in Brazil, Lewis Hamilton became the youn gest Formula One World\nChampion up to that point in Formula One history. After adopting a conservative strategy without risks for\nmost of the race to secure at least fifth place, and the title, a late-race rain shower caused unexpected\ntrouble. First, Hamilton was pushed down to fifth place by German Toyota driver Timo Glock who didn't\nenter the pits for intermediates like most other front runne rs. With just three laps to go, Sebastian Vettel then\nalso overtook the Briton on the track which meant he would end up with equal points to Massa, but with\none fewer victory. While everybody was focusing on the battle between these two (Vettel managed to stay\nin front in the end), against all expectations both were able to overtake Glock, who had lost all grip with his\ndry-weather tyres, in the very last corner before the finishing straight. This meant that, while the McLaren\nDrivers' Championship title rival Felipe Massa won the race in his Ferrari, Hamilton ultimately grabbed the\nfifth place he needed to become champion. Renault's Fernando Alonso, the previous younge st champion,\nwas second a head of Massa's teammate Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n and Toro Rosso's Sebastian Vettel.\nThe 2009 race determined another Drivers' Champion, with Jenson Button in a Brawn finishing fifth to\nsecure his only Drivers' Championship over Vettel, now driving for Red Bull, who finished fourth; Vettel's\nAustralian teammate Mark Webber won the race ahead of Pole Robert Kubica. 2010 saw a wet qualifying\nand German Nico H\u00fclkenberg drove an astonishing lap to put his non-competitive Williams on pole\nposition.

After making a very poor start\nwhich dropped him to 22nd, he climbed up to sixth which was enough to see him win his third consecutive\nDrivers' title. This race was also notable for being Michael Schumacher's last ever F1 race: the legendary\nGerman had made a comeback with Mercedes in 2010, but he did not win a single race \u2013 a huge  surprise,\nconsidering he was the most successful F1 driver in history. 2013 saw Vettel win his ninth consecutive race\nthat season which was a new record. The record stood until Max Verstappen won his tenth race in a row at\nthe 2023 Italian Grand Prix. 2014 saw the totally dominant Mercedes duo of Nico Rosberg and Lewis\nHamilton finish 1\u20132 i n the race. 2015 s aw Rosberg win again; he had spent most of that season de moralized\nand at the mercy of his teammate Hamilton, who won his third Drivers' Championship. 2016 saw continued\nMercedes domination, but it was Hamilton who won with Rosberg second.

Lewis Hamilton, after a disqualification from qualification due to technical infringements, won\nthe main race after achieving a fifth-place finish in the sprint after a back row start. Hamilton's 2022\nteammate, George Russell, won bot h races at S\u00e3o Paulo.\nFive Brazilian drivers have won the Brazilian Grand Prix, with Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton\nSenna and Felipe Massa each winning twice, and Carlos Pace winning once. The most wins ever is by the\nFrenchman Alain Prost, who has won the race six times (including five times at Jacarepagu\u00e1). Argentine\ndriver Carlos Reutemann and Michael Schumacher have both won four times.\nIn spring 2019, Jair Bolsonaro, the President of Brazil, announc ed that the Brazilian Grand Prix would\nmove back to Rio de Janeiro.[8] Because the Jacarepagu\u00e1 circuit had been demolished to make way for the\nconstruction of facilities for the 2016 Summer Olympics, a new circuit is to be built in the Deodoro\nneighbor hood of Rio de Janeiro.[8] However, this was denied by Formula One's commercial manager Sean\nBratches.[9]\nIn November 2020 a deal was signed which would see Formula One continue to race at Interlagos until\n2025, albeit unde r the title of S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix.[10][11] This was the first time that the race had been\nknow n as the S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix.
