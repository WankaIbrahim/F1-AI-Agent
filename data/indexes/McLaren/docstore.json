the\nMcLaren\nTechnology\nCentre  in\nWoking , Surrey , England. The team is a subsid iary of the McLaren Group, which owns a majority of the\nteam. McLaren is best known as a Formula One chassis constructor , the second-oldest active team and the\nsecond-most successful Formula One team after Ferrari , having won 186 races, 12 Drivers' Championships ,\nand eight Constructors' Champ ionships . McLaren  also has a history in American open wheel racing  as both\nan entrant and a chassis constructor , and has won the Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am) sports\ncar racing  championship.\nFounded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren , the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian\nGrand Prix, but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to 1971.\nFurther American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue  in\n1972  and Johnny Rutherford  in 1974  and 1976 . After Bruce McLa ren died in a testing accident in 1970,\nTeddy Mayer  took over and led the team to their first Formula One Constructors' Championship in 1974 ,\nwith Emerson Fittipaldi  and James Hunt  winning the Drivers' Championship in 1974 and 1976  respectively .\nThe year 1974 also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by the Marlboro  cigarette brand.\nIn 1981, McLaren merged with Ron Dennis ' Project Four Racing ; Dennis took over as team principal, and\nshortly afterwards organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team.\nThis began the team's most successful era; with Porsche  and Honda  engines, Niki Lauda , Alain Prost , and\nAyrton Senna won seven Drivers' Championships between them and the team took six Constructors'\nChampionships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant\u2014together they won all but\none race in 1988 \u2014but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari. Fellow English team Williams\noffered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between\n1984  and 1994 . By the mid-1990s, Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to\nWilliams, and the team went three seasons without a win. With Mercedes-Benz  engines, West sponsorship,\nand forme r William s designer Adrian Newey, further champions hips came in 1998  and 1999  with driver\nMika H\u00e4kkinen , and during the 2000s the team were consistent front-runners, with driver Lewis Hamilton\ntaking their latest title in 2008 .\nMcLaren is one of only three constructors, and the only team, to complete the Triple Crown of Motorsport\n(wins at the Indianapolis 500, 24 Hours of Le Mans , and Monaco Grand Prix), a feat that McLaren\nachieved by winning the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans .\nRon Dennis retired as McLaren team principal in 2009, handing over to long-time McLaren employee\nMartin Whitmarsh .

McLaren is using Mercedes-Benz engines from the 2021 season until at least\n2030.[10][11]\nAfter initially returning to the Indianapolis 500 in 2017  as a backer of Andretti Autosport  to run Fernando\nAlonso  and then in 2019  as an independent entry, McLaren announced in August 2019 that they would run\nin conjunction with Arrow Schmidt Peterson Motorsports starting in 2020  to run the full IndyCar Series ,\nthe combin ed entry being named Arrow McLaren SP.[12] Initially having no ownership interest in the team,\nMcLaren would purchase 75% of the operation in 2021.[13] McLaren  entered the electric off-road racing\nseries Extreme E  in 2022 ,[14] and also joined Formula E  in the 2022\u201323 season .[15]\nBruce McLaren Motor Racing was founded in 1963 by New Zealander\nBruce McLaren .[16] Bruce was a works  driver for the Britis h Formula One\nteam Cooper  with whom he had won three Grands Prix and come second in\nthe 1960  World Championship. Wanting to compete in the Australasian\nTasman Series , Bruce approached his employers, but when team owner\nCharles Cooper insisted on using 1.5-litre Formula One-specification\nengines instead of the 2.5-litre motors permitted by the Tasman rules, Bruce\ndecided to set up his own team to run him and his prospective Formula One\nteammate Timmy Mayer  with custom-built Cooper cars.[17]\nBruce won the 1964 serie s, but Mayer was killed in practice for the final\nrace at the Longford Circuit  in Tasmania . Whe n Bruce McLa ren approached\nTeddy Mayer to help him with the purchase of the Zerex sports car from\nRoger Penske, Teddy Mayer and Bruce McLaren began discussing a\nbusiness partnership resulting in Teddy Mayer buying in to Bruce McLaren\nMotor Racing Limited (BMMR) and ultimately becoming its largest\nshareholder .[18][19]\nThe team,  racing under the British licence ,[20] was based in Feltham , England from 1963 to 1964, and in\nColnbrook , England from 1965 until 1981, and it has been based in Woking , England since 1981.[21]\nDespite this, Bruce never used the traditional British racing green  on his cars. Instead, he used colour\nschemes that were not based on national principles  (e.g. his first Formula One car, the McLaren M2B car,\nraced at the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix, was painted white with a green stripe, to represent a fictional\nYamura team in John Frankenheimer 's film Grand Prix ).[22]History", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2628, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c61c3f9d-6aaa-4d66-b137-c3e4d903dd18": {"__data__": {"id_": "c61c3f9d-6aaa-4d66-b137-c3e4d903dd18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "82c5d8ab-947c-47ce-bd62-2cb08e93c470", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "1fb740608e040eb080a6dceb6f988c8fc5cd646bd0060063a1d448344d111858", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "McLaren's\noriginal logo was\ndesigned by\nMichael Turner\nand featured a\nkiwi bird, a New\nZealand\nicon.[25][26]\nThe McLaren M2B, the team's first\nFormula One car\nThe McLaren M7A of 1968 gave\nMcLaren their first Formula One\nwins.

Bruce won\nthe Race of Champions  at the Brands Hatch circuit and Hulme won\nthe International Trophy at Silverstone , both non-champi onship\nraces,[34] before Bruce took the team's first championship win at the\nBelgian Grand Prix.[35] Hulme also won the Italian  and Canadian\nGrands Prix later in the year, helping the team to second in the\nConstructors' Championship. Using an updated 'C' version on the\nM7,[36] a further three podium finishes followed for Bruce in 1969 ,\nbut the team's fifth win had to wait until the last race of the 1969\nchampionship when Hulme won the Mexican Grand Prix. That year,\nMcLaren experimented with four-wheel drive  in the M9A , but the\ncar had only a single outing driven by Derek Bell at the British\nGrand Prix; Bruce described driving it as like \"trying to write your\nsignature with somebody jogging your elbow\".[37]Racing history: Formula One\nEarly days (1966\u20131967)\nFord-Cosworth DFV engines (1968\u20131982)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2884, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e87d68f0-9c69-4cd0-951f-c13b715c2aab": {"__data__": {"id_": "e87d68f0-9c69-4cd0-951f-c13b715c2aab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "efcb1d12-3901-40f2-8499-cf53488af5f2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "48f083d0d53e780be1e094402800ac3dce767ab2ebe2b4f61360e5a8865051b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9efa4214-9fa8-4bb5-afb0-2b73edcfbfe6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6ed6c7953219a531b68434aa48bb9f82577bcfb38d8ae088ce7102b11bb73e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Emerson Fittipaldi won the 1974\nDrivers' Championship with\nMcLaren.The year 1970  started with a second-place each for Hulme and Bruce in the first two Grands  Prix, but in\nJune, Bruc e was killed in a crash at Goodwood  while testing the new M8D Can-Am car.[36] After his death,\nTeddy Mayer  took over effective control of the team ;[19] Hulme continued with Dan Gurney  and Peter\nGethin  partnering him.

The car with a small\nblock Oldsmobile had immediate success driven by Bruce McLaren.\nThe car was raced in North America and Europe in 1964 in various\nA sports and United States Road Racin g Championship events. In\n1965 the team car was the M1A  prototype from which the\nproduction Elva M1As were based. In late 1965, the M1B (also\nknown as Mk2) was the team car for the North American races at\nthe end of the year. For the Can-Am Series, which started in 1966,\nMcLaren created the M3 which Bruce  and Chris Amon  drove \u2013\ncustomer cars also appeared in severa l races in the 1966 season .\nWith the M3, they led two races but scored no wins, and the\ninaugural title was taken by John Surtees in a Lola T70. The following year, Robin Herd purpose-designed\nthe Chevrolet  V8-powered M6A , delays with the Formula One programme allowing the team to spend\nextra resou rces on developing the Can-Am car which was the first to be painted in McLaren orange. With\nDenny Hulme now partnering Bruce, they won five of six races and Bruce won the championship, setting\nthe pattern for the next four years. In the 1968 season , they used a new car, the M8, to win four races; non-\nworks McLarens took the other two, but this time Hulme was victorious overall. In the 1969 season ,\nMcLaren domination became total as they won all 11 races with the M8B; Hulme won five, and Bruce won\nsix and the Drivers' Championship.[31] From 1969 onwards, McLaren M12 \u2013 the customer \"variant\" of the\nM8 \u2013 was driven by several entrants, including a version modified by Jim Hall of Chaparral fame.\nMcLaren's success in Can-Am brought with it financial rewards, both prize money and money from selling\ncars to other teams, that helped to support the team and fund the nascent and relatively poor-paying\nFormula One programme.[31][198]\nWhen Bruce was killed testing the 1970 season 's M8D, he was at first replaced by Dan Gurney , then later\nby Peter Geth in. They won two and one races, respec tively , while Hulme won six on the way to the\nchampionship. Private teams competing in the 1970 Can-Am series included older M3Bs as well as the\nM12 \u2013 the customer  version of the team's M8B. In the 1971 season , the team held off the challenge of 1969\nworld champion Jackie Stewart  in the Lola T260, winning eight races, with Peter Revson taking the title.\nHulme also won three Can-Am races in the 1972 season , but the McLaren M20  was defeated by the\nPorsche 917/10s of Mark Donohue  and Geor ge Follmer .

Brown also stated that McLaren\nchose to partner with Schmidt Peterson Motorsports because their\nprevious efforts fielding their team with assistance from Andretti\nAutosport and Carlin exclusively for the Indianapolis 500 had not\nbeen successful and that the purchase  of the IndyCar Series by\nPenske Entertainment  gave McLaren more confidence in the long\nterm viability and stability of the series compared to the previous\nownership under Tony Geor ge.[215]\nIn August  2021, it was announced that McLaren Racing will\nacquire a majority stake in the IndyC ar Team.

Author Mark Hughes\nsays, \"over 220\" McLarens were built by Trojan.[31] In USAC\ncompetition and Formula One, too, many teams used McLarens during the late 1960s and 1970s.[276] A\n1972 M8F was rebuilt as the C8 for use in Group C  racing in 1982, but had little success.[277]\nIn the mid-1990s, McLaren Racing's sister company , McLaren Cars (now McLaren Automotive) built a\nracing version of their F1 road car, the F1 GTR  which won the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans  and the 1995\nand 1996 BPR Glob al GT Series .[278] In 2011, a GT3 version of the MP4-12C  road car was develo ped in\npartnership with CRS Racing, making its competitive debut at the VLN  and ADAC GT Masters  in\n2012.[279] The MP4-12C was succeeded by the McLaren 650S  and then the McLaren 720S  for GT3 racing,\nwhile a GT4 version of the McLaren 570S was also developed as well.\nIn 2022, McLaren Automotive announced a new GT4 model based on the McLaren Artura ,[280] along with\nan unrestricted version named the Artura Trophy , which is to be used in McLaren's planned one-make\nseries.[281]\nIn October 2023, McLaren Automotive announced its intent to participate in the 2024 24 Hours of Le Mans\nunder the new LMGT3  category through CEO Zak Brown's United Autosports  as its customer team.[282]\nMcLaren Automotiv e also announced that it will enter the 2024 IMSA  SportsCar Championship  under the\nGT Daytona Pro (GTD Pro) category through Pfaff Motorsports as its customer team.[283] Both  UnitedOther series\nCustomer racing", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3073, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c7be120-57a2-4ca5-9180-bce0939c5894": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c7be120-57a2-4ca5-9180-bce0939c5894", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e773ca86-9263-4453-9924-d05ff8078db3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "705dba23ee18bb125d96b186686798d886dc9f683bd836837975b90a5d1d55c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Ron Dennis, here pictured\nat the 2000 Monaco Grand\nPrix, was team principal\nfrom 1980 to 2009 and was\nchairman of the McLaren\nGroup until 2017.Autosports and Pfaff Motorsports will be using the McLaren 720S GT3 Evo. In the following month,\nMcLaren Automotive confirmed its participation in the 2024 FIA World Endurance Championship season\nin the LMGT3 category in collaboration with United Autosports.[284][285]\nMcLaren Racing is majority owned by the McLaren Group , having sold 15% of the team to American\ninvestors MSP  Sports Capital in 2020, rising to a 33% stake in 2022.[286] The team had previously been\nwholly owned by the Group since its inception.\nAfter Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, Teddy Mayer  took\nover the team. In 1981, McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four\nRacing; Dennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a\nbuyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team.\nDennis offered Mansour Ojjeh the chanc e to purchase 50% of the team in\n1983, with McLaren becoming a joint venture with Ojjeh's TAG Group . In\n2000, after supplying engines to the team through its Mercedes  subsidiary\nfor 5 years, DaimlerChrysler  (now Daimler AG) exercised an option to buy\n40% of the TAG McLaren Group.[287] Dennis and Ojjeh each retained a\n30% share ,[288] and each sold half of their stake to the Mumtalakat Holding\nCompany  (the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom of Bahrain ) in\n2007.[289] Although Daimler were reportedly considering acquiring the\nremaining 60% from Dennis and Ojjeh, they instead bought Brawn GP\n(renaming it Mercedes GP) in Nove mber 2009;[290] their McLaren shares\nwere sold back to Mumtalakat, Dennis, and Ojjeh in 2010.[291]\nDennis stepped down as both CEO and team principal of McLaren in 2009,\nhanding both roles over to Martin Whitmarsh.[292][293] However , following\nthe uncom petitive 2013 season, Dennis retook the role in January\n2014;[294] Whitmar sh formally left the team later that year.[295] Dennis\nsought to take a controlling interest in the company , but his relationship\nwith Ojjeh had deteriorated, perhaps as early as 2013.[296][297] In 2016,\nDennis was forced out of his role as CEO by Ojjeh.[298] He sold his remain ing shares in the company the\nnext year .[299]\nAfter Dennis' 2014 return, he had abolished the position of team principal at McLaren, saying it was an\n'outdated' position.[300] \u00c9ric Boullier  was instead named racing director in January 2014, becoming\nresponsible for the F1 team.[301] After Dennis' exit, Zak Brow n was chosen for the post of Group execu tive\ndirector , with the positions of Group CEO and Racing CEO both being left vacant.[302] While his position\nwas formally within the wider McLaren  Group, it was understood that his role would focus only on the F1\nteam. The increasing awareness of the mediocrity of the car prompted a reshuf fle in 2018: Brown was\nappointed McLaren Racing CEO in April, and when Boullier resigned in July, his position was divided\nbetween Gil de Ferran  as sportin g director and Andrea Stella  as perform ance director .[303] In May 2019,\nAndreas Seidl  was appointed as the new team principal.[304] In December 2022, Seidl left McLaren to join\nSauber  as CEO with Stella promoted to team principal.[305][306]Characteristics\nOwnership and management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3330, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b0b33e2-18ee-4369-8faf-7472c6ed4fef": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b0b33e2-18ee-4369-8faf-7472c6ed4fef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "951d66d8-0bde-40b1-99c9-71d24e44945e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "efffeaa22918525137bec7fd027d20a02d1746b6ff2d5d31417f41c3683df9da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "McLaren's Formula One team was\nsponsored for 23 years by Philip\nMorris's Marlboro cigarette brand.Since 2004 the team has been based at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, England.[307] Facilities\nthere include a wind tunnel and a driving simulator which is said to be the most sophisticated in the\nsport.[308] The team  also created the McLaren Driver Development Programme , which currently has eight\ndrivers signed to it as of July 2024.[309][310]\nMcLaren has had an uneasy relationship  with Formula One's governing body , the FIA, and its predecessor\nFISA, as well as with the commercial rights holders of the sport. McLaren was involved, along with the\nother teams of the Formula One Constructors Association  (FOCA), in a dispute with FISA  and Alfa Romeo,\nRenault, and Ferrari over control of the sport in the early 1980s. During this dispute, known as the FISA-\nFOCA  war, a breakaway series  was threatened, FISA  refused to sanction one race, and FOCA  boycotted\nanother . It was eventually resolved by a revenue-sharing deal called the Concorde Agreement .[311][312][313]\nSubsequent Concorde Agreements were signed in 1987 and 1992, but in 1996, McLaren was again one of\nthe teams which disputed the terms of a new agreement, this time with former FOCA  president Bernie\nEcclestone 's Formula One Promotions and Administration  organisation; a new 10-year agreeme nt was\neventually signed in 1998.[314] Similar arguments restarted in the mid- 2000s, with McLaren and their part-\nowner Mercedes again threatening to start a rival series, before another Concord e Agreement was signed in\n2009.[315] In 2007, McLaren were involved in an espionage controver sy after their chief designer Mike\nCoughlan  obtained confidential technical inform ation from Ferrari. McLaren was excluded from the\nConstructors' Cham pionship for one year, and the team was fined US$100 million.[109][316] Although the\nterms of the most recent agreements, in 2013 and 2021, have been extensively negotiated on, McLaren\nhave not taken as openly hostile a stance as in the past.\nMcLaren's Formul a One team was originally called Bruce\nMcLar en Motor  Racing , and for their first season ran white-and-\ngreen coloured cars, which came about as a result of a deal with the\nmakers of the film Grand Prix.[317] Between 1968  and 1971 , the\nteam used an orange design, which was also applied to cars\ncompeting in the Indianapolis 500 and Can-Am series, and was used\nas an interim testing livery in later years.[317][318][319]\nIn 1968 , the Royal Automobile Club  and the FIA relaxed the rules\nregarding commercial sponsorship of Formula One cars, and in\n1972 , the Yardley of London  cosmetics company became McLaren's\nfirst title sponsor and the team raced as Yardley Team\nMcLar en.[320][321] As a result, the livery was changed to a predominantly white one to reflect the sponsor's\ncolours.[322] This changed in 1974 , when Philip Morris joined as title sponsor through their Marlboro\ncigarette brand, whilst one car continued  to run\u2014ostensibly by a separate team\u2014with Yardley livery for the\nyear.[321] Marlboro 's red-and- white branding lasted until 1996 , during which time the team went by various\nnames incorporating the word \"Marlboro\", making it the then longest-running  Formula One sponsorship\n(and still the longest title sponsorship, which has since been surpassed by Hugo Boss ' sponsorship of the\nteam, which ran from 1981  to 2014 ).[323][324][325][326]Politics\nSponsorship, naming, and livery", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3493, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4767b4b-98d9-48cc-b22b-eb2f29594cff": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4767b4b-98d9-48cc-b22b-eb2f29594cff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c20f31b6-2f40-44ea-9ebd-b6d3cbc3b31d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "b962ee2d77d105a5de84578cdf626b0a21614530cfcb77efe6c27c3d57ceacef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In 1997 , Philip Morris moved its Marlboro sponsorship to Ferrari and was replaced by Reemtsma's West\ncigarette branding, with the team enter ing under the name West McLar en Mercedes .[327] As a result,\nMcLaren adopted a silver and black livery . By mid-2005, a European Union directive  banned tobacco\nadvertising  in sport,  which forced McLaren to end its association with West.[328] In 2006 , the team\ncompeted without a title sponsor , entering under the name Team McLar en Mercedes . McLaren altered\ntheir livery to introduce red into the design, and changed the silver to chrome.\nIn 2007 , McLaren signed a seven-year contract with telecommunications company Vodafone , and became\nknown as Vodafone McLar en Mercedes .[329] The arran gement was due to last until 2014 , although the\nteam announced at the 2013 Australian Grand Prix that their partnershi p would conclude at the end of the\n2013 season.[330] Despite explaining  the decision to conclude the sponsorship as being a result of\nVodafone's desire to reconsider its commercial opportunities, it was later repor ted that the decision to run\nthe 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix despite an ongoing civil uprising  and protests against the race, and Vodafone's\ninability to remove their logos from the McLaren cars during the race as being a key factor in the decision\nto terminate the sponsorship.[331] Diageo -owned whisky brand Johnnie Walker , an associate sponsor since\n2005, offered to take over as title sponsor at the end of 2013, but their offer of \u00a343 million was turned down\nby McLaren chairman Ron Dennis, who believed it to be \"too small.\"[332]\nAt the end of 2015, it was announced  that McLaren was due to lose sponsor TAG Heuer to Red Bull\nRacing. McLaren chief Ron Dennis later admitted to falling out with TAG Heuer CEO Jean-Claude Biver .\nIn 2015, McLaren was without a title sponsor and was set to lose a further \u00a320 million in sponsorship in\n2016.[332] Between 2015 and 2017, the team competed as McLar en Honda  due to their engine partnership\nwith Honda.[333] The team has competed as McLar en F1 Team since 2018.[334] CEO Zak Brown has said\nthat he will not be selling the name of the team to a title sponsor to keep the team's name intact and will be\nlooking for major sponsors instead.[335][336]\nMcLaren's cars were originally named with the letter M followed by a number , sometimes also followed by\na letter denoting the model.[337] After the 1981 merger with Project Four, the cars were called \"MP4/x\", or\nsince 2001  \"MP4-x \",[338] where x is the generation of the chassis (e.g. MP4/1 , MP4-22 ). \"MP4\" stood\ninitially for \"Marlboro Project 4\",[339] so that the full title of the cars (McLar en MP4/x) reflected not only\nthe historical name of the team, but also the names of the team's major sponsor and its new component part.\nSince the change of title sponsor in 1997, \"MP4\" was said to stand for \"McL aren Project 4\".[340] From\n2017, following Ron Dennis' departure from the team, the naming scheme of the cars changed to \"MCL\"\nfollowed by a numb er.[341] Since 2017, McLar en have increasingly adopted orange colours, designed to\nrecall Bruce McLaren's liveries.\nIn 2019 , British American Tobacco  (BAT) agreed to a global partnership with McLaren under its \"A Better\nTomorrow\" campaig n to promote BAT's alternative smoking products Vuse (previous ly Vype) and Velo\n(previously Lyft).[342] The agreement has enticed a similar controversy to the Mission Winnow  sponsorsh ip\nwith Scuderia Ferrari due to the association with tobacco companies.[343] In late 2019, BAT and McLaren\nannounced the signing of an enhanced partnership deal that saw BAT beco me a principal partner of\nMcLaren with increased branding position and the partnership being extended to the McLaren IndyCar\nTeam.[344] In April 2024, McLaren and BAT announced a partnership extension which includes the\npartnership being extended to the McLaren Formula E Team.[345]\nIn July 2020, McLaren announced a multi-year strategic partnership with long time sponsor Gulf Oil\nInternational ,[346] which includes Gulf Oil being the preferred lubricant supplier to McLaren\nAutomotive[347] and a special Gulf livery for the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix .[348]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4197, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33607596-b4f0-4901-a232-ca7ca0a03b87": {"__data__": {"id_": "33607596-b4f0-4901-a232-ca7ca0a03b87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f3cc370e-4398-489f-b335-67a8bb236228", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "McLaren.pdf"}, "hash": "c9a3fa115463c4edc04df7b339b82b5e93b7b0e6c704ea056089d8209bf4c298", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In May 2022, OKX  signed a multi-year sponsorship deal with McLaren as a primary partner .[349] The deal\nwas expanded in March 2023 with OKX becoming McLaren's official primary partner where OKX will\nreceive increased branding presence on the car.
