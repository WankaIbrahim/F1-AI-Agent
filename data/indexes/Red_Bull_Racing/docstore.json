The team operated under a British racing licence from 2005  to 2006 .[16]\nRed Bull Racing was not the start of Red Bull's involvement in Formula One, as they sponsored Sauber\nfrom 1995 to 2004. After buying a Formula One team of its own, Red Bull ended its long-term\npartnership with the Swiss team. Red Bull also runs a young drivers programme, Red Bull Junior Team,\nwhereby Red Bull sponsors promising  young drivers. High-profile drivers who have received this\nbacking include Enrique Bernoldi , Christian Klien, Patrick Friesacher , Vitantonio Liuzzi  and Scott Spee d.\nRed Bull also spon sors many drivers and teams competing in the Formula 2 Championship , Formula\nOne's \"feeder\" series.\nRed Bull's owner , Dietrich Mateschitz , reportedly tried to recruit\nformer Formula One driver and BMW  Motorsport  chief (and\nfellow Austrian) Gerhard Berger to help guide the team through its\ndebut season. However , this was never realised. For 2005 , the\nchassis was christened the RB1. Red Bull Racing used Cosworth\nengines in its maiden year due to the ease of continuing with the\nengine Jaguar Racing used.\nFormer McLaren  driver David Coulthard led the team. Coulthard\nwas chosen for his experience, considered ideal to help lead the\nfledgling team. For the second car, Red Bull shared the drive between two of its young sponsored drivers:\nChristian Klien , who had driven for Jaguar in 2004  and 2004 F3000  champion Vitantonio Liuzzi . At first,\nit was announced that Klien and Liuzzi would swap driving duty every four races, but by the end of the\nseason, Liuzzi had appeared only four times.Cosworth engines (2005)\n2005 season", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2751, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ae412e7-4908-479c-b5dc-e36d645257cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ae412e7-4908-479c-b5dc-e36d645257cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Red_Bull_Racing.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "592b8404-acb8-4796-9eff-c12a33c2a954", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Red_Bull_Racing.pdf"}, "hash": "2384d3736d996cfd87148df3790ca42fcbb854aaeae4395cdb82442eebb33147", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Coulthard driving the RB2 at the 2006\nGerman Grand PrixRed Bull's first year in Formula One was a massive success compared to its predecessors, Jaguar Racing.\nThey were 6th in the Constructors' Championship for most of the season, only beaten by the fast-\nimproving BAR Hondas at the end of the season. In a single season, they amassed more points than\nJaguar had in 2003  and 2004. Coulthar d, after a poor 2003 and 2004 with McLaren, was a revelation for\nthe team while Klien showed that he had vastly improved from 2004.  Over all they scored  34 points; 24\nfor Coulthard, 9 for Klien and 1 for Liuzzi. Red Bull Racing was a consist ent point and occasional\npodium  challenger for most of their debut season.\nAmerican driver Scott Speed , who rose through the ranks in the American equivalent of the Red Bull\nJunior Team, Red Bull Driver Search , was Red Bull Racing's third drive r in 2005 for the Canadian  and\nUnited States  Grands Prix. Speed was attractive to Red Bull Racing because of his American nationality\nwhich would raise the profile of both Red Bull and Formula One in Americ a, a market where the sport\nhas traditionally struggled to make an impact.\nOn 23 April 2005, the team announced a deal to utilise customer Ferrari  engines in 2006 . This coincided\nwith a rule change mandating the use of V8 engines , making it likely that both Red Bull Racing and\nFerrari would use the same specification engine. Red Bull Racing continued to use Michelin  tyres , rather\nthan the Bridgestones  used by Ferrari.\nOn 8 November 2005, Red Bull Racing hired Adrian Newey,\nthe highly successful McLaren  technical director .[17]\nOn 15 December 2005, the team's second car, the Red Bull\nRB2, hit the track for the first time. David Coulthard\ncompleted a handful of laps of the Silverstone  circuit in\nEngland, and declared the new car was a \"sexy looking\nthing\".[18] In early testing Red Bull was plagued with cooling\nproblems and overheating of car components.[19]\nAt the opening race of the 2006 season in Bahrain , Christian\nKlien  qualified  eighth (ahead of Giancarlo Fisichell a's\nRenault and both BMWs). Coulthard had problems when he\nflat-spotted a tyre fighting with Nick Heidfeld , and finish ed 10th; the cooling problems returned when his\nFerrari  engine expired on the slowing down lap, forcing a grid penalty for the following race. In\nMalaysia , Coulthar d made up several places from the back of the grid but was forced to retire with\nhydraulic problems,  while Klien had an opening lap incident with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen  and after pitting for\nrepairs also retired with hydraulic failure. Coulthard got a point in Australia  after Scott Speed was\npenalised for passing him under the yellow flags. The following races were marred with retirements and\nlowly finishes.\nCoulthard finished 3rd at Monaco , the team's first podium finish. Team boss Christian Horner said before\nthe race that if one of his cars were to finish on the podium, he would jump into a swimming pool at the\ntrack naked.

However , in testing at Barcelona  Coulthard has set the fastest lap in the new configuration of\nthe circuit (since superseded by Felipe Massa ). Coulthard secured the team's first points by scoring a\ngritty 5th with a faulty gearbox on his closing laps in Spain , while Webber was dogged with hydraulic\nproblems all weekend, eventually retiring from the race after failing to set a competitive lap in qualifying.\nThe performance hike the team experienced at the Catalan track left both drivers and team optimistic\nabout their future results, with reliability troubles being as much a focus as the increase of their already\ncompetitive pace.\nRed Bull Racing further strengthened their technical department by hiring Geof f Willis as Technical\nDirector on 17 July 2007.[23]\nAfter this, the drivers seemed to have a stroke of good luck during the unpred ictable and exciting 2007\nEuropean Grand Prix in which Webber finished 3rd, his second career podium.

Complaints were\nissued to the FIA from rival teams, but they were discarded by the\nsport's governing body .[111] Neither Red Bull Racing nor Scuderia\nToro Ross o denied they ran fundamentally the same chassis, but\nclaimed the separate development programs, different engines and\nin their opinion that the chassis was designed by neither team\nmade it legal.[112]\nThe regulations were changed in 2010 to forbid the use of\nidentical cars between teams, and Toro Rosso no longer had its\ncars produced by Red Bull Technology .

The car\nwould be designed by Adrian Newey, Chief Technical Officer at\nRed Bull Racing. Only 50 units are to be made, with production\nscheduled to begin in 2025.[120] The prototype was revealed to\nthe public at Goodwood Festival of Speed  by Oracle Red Bull\nRacing Team in July 2024.[121]\nIn the autumn of 2005, Red Bull annou nced that they had purchased the cash-strapped Minardi  Formula\nOne team, and it would be known as Scuderia Toro Rosso  (Italian for Team Red Bull)(STR) from 2006\nonwards. STR operates as a separate team, but the two share certain technical resources. In 2006, STR\nused a chassis based on the 2005 Red Bull Racing Red Bull RB1 chassis, originally designed by Jaguar\nRacing, and Minardi's contracted supply  of rev-limited V10 Cosworth  engines. It was widely speculated\nthat the 2007 chassis for both teams would be essentially the same Adrian Newey  design, although Red\nBull was careful to announce that the \"STR2 will be built by Red Bull Technol ogy, and Toro Rosso willSister  Formula One team", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2234, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5faae4e-34da-480f-9d36-a19ebc845b94": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5faae4e-34da-480f-9d36-a19ebc845b94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Red_Bull_Racing.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d8507668-f5bc-4b15-a000-9d7d6bce0136", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Red_Bull_Racing.pdf"}, "hash": "d4fc21d5619ee8ba3dd8c8158f2027eba2a7003b50378a2cbe9b0664bb062893", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "fully own the intelle ctual rights of the car\".[122] Formula One teams  are not allowed to use another team's\nchassis. STR has been used as a 'B' team for Red Bull Racing, allowing the company to work with more\ndrivers. As of the 2010 season this arrangement was outlawed, and the STR5 is the first Toro Rosso car\ndesigned and built in-house.[123] In 2006, Red Bull Racing driver Vitantonio Liuzzi  was given  a full-time\nseat with STR alongside another Red Bull sponsored driver , Scott Speed . Liuzzi retained his seat in STR\nfor the 2007 season. Sebastian Vettel replaced Speed in the middle of the 2007 season, and S\u00e9bastien\nBourdais  replaced Liuzzi at STR for the 2008  season. Against expectation, Toro Rosso performed well\nduring the 2008 season and Sebastian Vettel won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. This meant that STR took\ntheir first win before  Red Bull Racing, and helped to secure Vettel a drive with Red Bull Racing for 2009\nwhen he also took that team's first win.\nFor 2020 , the team was rebranded as Scuderia AlphaT auri to promote Red Bull's fashion brand of the\nsame name.[124] Scuderia AlphaT auri achieved their maiden Grand Prix win under the new name at the\n2020 Italian Grand Prix. The race marked Pierre Gasly 's first career race victory and the first for a French\ndriver since Olivier Panis  won the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix  24 years prior .\nFor 2024 , the team was rebranded as RB Formu la One Team and is competing as Visa Cash App RB\nFormula One Team.
