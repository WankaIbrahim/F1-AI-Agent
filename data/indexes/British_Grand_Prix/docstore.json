First held by the Royal Automobile\nClub  (RAC) in 1926 , the Britis h Grand Prix has been\nheld annually since 1948  and has been a round of the\nFIA Formula One World Championsh ip every year\nsince 1950 . In 1952 , following the transfer of the\nlease of the Silverstone Circuit  to the British Racing\nDrivers' Club,[1] the RAC delegated the organisation\nof races held at Silverstone to the BRDC,[2] and\nthose held at Aintree  to the British Automobile\nRacing Club .[3] This arrangement lasted until the\nRAC created the Motor Sports Association in the late\n1970s and it recla imed organising control of the\nevent. The RAC MSA was renamed Motorsport UK\nin 2019 when it formally split from the RAC.\nThe British Grand Prix is currently held at the\nSilverstone Circuit  near the village of Silverstone  in\nNorthamptonshire  in England. The 2019 event was\nthe 70th time that the race had been run as a World\nChampionship event since the inaugural season in\n1950 , and the 53rd time that a World Championship\nround had been held at Silverstone.\nThe British race is the oldest in the Formula One\nWorld Championship calendar as the 1950 race at\nSilverstone was round one of the first championship\nseason in 1950 . It and the Italian Grand Prix are the\nonly two Formula One World Championship Grands\nPrix that have been staged during every season that\nthe champ ionship has been held. The British Grand\nPrix was a round of the World Manufacturers'\nChampionship  in both 1926 and 1927, but was never\nheld during the existence of the European\nChampionship . It was designated the European Grand Prix five times between 1950 and 1977, when this\ntitle was an honorar y designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe.

It was the first purpose-built motor racing venue, as well as one of the first airfields in\nthe United Kingdom. Grand Prix motor racing first came to Britain in 1926, following the successes of\nHenry Segrave  in winning the 1923 French Grand Prix and the San Sebasti\u00e1n Grand Prix the following\nyear, both in a Sunbeam  Grand Prix car, which raised interest in the sport domestically and demonstrated\nto the AIACR  that the advances made in the British motor industry merited the honour of hosting an\ninternational grand prix motor race. The first ever British Grand Prix (officially known as the Grand Prix\nof the Royal Automobile Club ) was held at Brooklands on 7 August 1926[5] and was won by Robert\nS\u00e9n\u00e9chal  and Louis Wagner driving a Delage 15 S 8.[6] The second Grand Prix of the RAC was also held\nat Brooklands, on 1 October 1927,[7] and was again won by a Delage 15 S 8, this time driven by Robert\nBenoist .\nSeveral non-champi onship races known as the Donington Grand Prix were held at Donington Park in\nLeicestershire  near Derby  which attracted the best European teams in 1937  and 1938 , where the German\nMercedes and Auto Unions dominated the proceedings. The German Bernd Rosemeyer  and the Italian\nTazio Nuvolari (both driving mid-e ngined Auto Unio n cars) won this race in 1937 and 1938, respectively ,\nbut as the races were organised by the Derby & District Motor Club[8] rather than by (or on behalf of) the\nRoyal Automobile Club, they are not usually accorded the \"British Grand Prix\" title.\nBrooklands had been severely damaged by the onset of World War II and the circuit was abandoned.\nMost new British circuits were being built on disused Royal Air Force  airfields, and Silver stone, located\non the Northamptonshire/Buckinghams hire border in central England equidist ant between London and\nBirmingham (the latter being the capital of the UK production car industry)- was one of those circuits. It\nstaged its first race, the Royal Automobile Club International Grand Prix on 2 October 1948, which was\nwon by Italian Luigi Villoresi  in a Maserati. In 1949, the circuit was heavily modified and made very fast;\nand it remained in this configuration for decades.\nIn 1950, the World Championship of Drivers was introduced, and the 1950 British Grand Prix was the\nfirst World Championship Formula One race ever held, with new regulations and 6 other races in Europe.\nThis race was won by Alfa Romeo driver Giuseppe \"Nino\" Farina. King Geor ge VI was among the\nattendees of the race. The 1951 race was particularly exciting, as it was the first F1 race not won by an\nAlfa Romeo; the gas-guzzling Italian cars were beaten by another Italian car- the more fuel-ef ficient\nFerrari of Argentine Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez in what was the famed Scuderia's first ever Formula OneHistory\nBrooklands (1926\u20131927)\nSilverstone (1948\u20131954)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3049, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d00b74b2-6cef-4e43-b104-ae4a9e96d9f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d00b74b2-6cef-4e43-b104-ae4a9e96d9f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "British_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d30b90b8-3c26-41ba-a141-2c39f9389412", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "British_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "104be4529f6d01529bcfa3c6ce00c00cd971bcb47e99d6863eebb449a13aa2bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "victory .

Mercedes drivers Juan Manuel Fangio  and\nhome favourite Stirling Moss  arriv ed at Aintree expecting to win. They took the lead at the start and the\ntwo drivers battled throughout, and Moss passed Fangio on the 26th lap, and he kept the lead for a while;\nbut Fangio  fought back and was about to pass Moss on the last corner on the last lap, and all were certain\nFangio would pip Moss at the chequered  flag.

This was the first Grand Prix\nvictory for a British-built car- Formula One would soon be mostly made up of British teams. 1958 was\nwhen Peter Collins won in a Ferrari and Bernie Ecclestone  was entered in a Connaught but his car was\ndriven by Jack Fairman , and 1959 and 1960 saw Australian Jack Brabham win in a mid-engined Cooper .\nThe last race at Aintree was in 1962 when Briton Jim Clark won his first of 5 British Grands Prix; Aintree\nwas decommissioned in 1964.\n1964 saw the first Formula One race at the southern English circuit known as Brands Hatch , located in\nancient woodlands in Kent, just outside London . The track was built in the early 1950s and had been\nextended in 1960 to include the new Grand Prix course. Silverstone hosted the British Grand Prix in odd-\nnumbered years and Brands Hatch in even-numbered years. Like Silverstone, the circuit was popular with\ndrivers, and unlike the flat Northampt onshire circuit and Aintree, Brands Hatch had many cambered\ncorners and varying elevation. Like the year before at Silverstone, Clark won the 1964 race and the next\nyear's race. 1967 saw Clark take yet another dominant win, and 1968 saw a monumental battle between\nSwiss Jo Siffert in a Lotu s and New Zealander Chris Amon in a Ferrari; Siffert won the race, his first of\ntwo victor ies in F1 on the circuit where he would lose his life in a non-cham pionship race three years\nlater.\n1969 saw another big battle between home favourite Jackie Stewart  and Austrian Jochen Rindt , that went\non for a while; although Rindt had a loose rear wing and had to come into the pits to get it repaired;\nStewart took the chequered flag driving  a Ford/Cosworth-powered Matra for Ken Tyrrell . Rind t won the\n1970 event at the expense of Brabham running out of fuel at the end of the race, and 1971 saw Stewart\nwin again in a Tyrrell (Ken Tyrrell had started building his own cars). 1973, however , saw a huge first lap\naccident at Woodcote that took out 11 cars, including all three works Surtees cars.

But Brands Hatch's\ndemise was for other reasons: the international motorsports governing body at the time, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\nInternationale du Sport Automobile  (FISA), had institut ed a policy of long-term contracts for one circuit\nper Grand Prix. Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility , and consideri ng most of the track was\nlocated in a very old forest it did have very little run-of f and room to expand, something Silverstone had\nin acres. Silverstone  and the BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with Formula 1 and FISA  at some\npoint in 1986, to run from 1987 to 1993.[10]\n1987 saw Silverstone modified; the Woodcote chicane was no longer used and a new left-right chicane\nwas built on the Farm Straight just before Woodcote. Silverstone's layout, like Brands Hatch, had\nchanged little since 1949. The circuit was still fast, and it saw Mansell charge after Piquet (who had\ndecided to run the whole race on one set of tyres) and the British driver broke the lap record 11 times,\ncaught and passed Piquet and took victory; the Silverstone crowd broke ranks and ran onto the circuit\nafter the race was over; this was to start a number of dramatic events surroundi ng Mansell for the next 5\nyears. 1988 saw Senna win a rain-soaked event, and Mansell finished 2nd after driving very hard and\npassing many cars to attempt to catch Senna; this was one of Mansell's two race finishes that season.\n1989 saw Prost win in a McLaren after his teammate Senna went off at Becke tts; Mansell finished 2nd\nagain driving for Ferrari; and sometime after the event, it was decided that Silverstone, the fastest circuit\non the Formula One calendar , was to be heavily modified, and the project would be completed for 1991.\nThe 1990 Grand Prix was the last motor race on the high-speed circuit; and Mansell drove hard and led a\nlot of the race; but gearbox problems eventually forced him to retire, where he threw his gloves into the\ncrowd and announced that he was going to retire, a decision that he would  later take back; and he\neffectively dominate d the next two events, driving for Williams. The circuit was now more technical, 15\npercent slower and every corner on the circuit except Copse was different. It also included an infield\nsection right before the pits. After 1992, Mansell had retired from F1, and 1993  saw new Williams driver\nDamon Hill lead much of the race until his engine blew up, and Hill's French teammate Alain Prost took\nhis 50th career Grand Prix win.\nAfter the tragedies of Imola in 1994, a chicane was installed at the flat-out Abbey corner 6 weeks before\nthe event was due to take place and Stowe corner was slowed considerably . Hill won the event,\nsomething his double world champion father Graham  never did. 1995 saw another British driver , Johnny\nHerbert, take victory in his Benetton. 1996 saw further changes to the circuit, where Stowe was more or\nless restored to its 1991 design, and the 1999 event saw double world champ ion Michael Schumacher\ncrash heavily at Stowe; he broke his leg, missed many races and this put him out of championship\ncontention. There were attempts to bring the British GP back to Brands Hatch for 2002, but this never\nmaterialised.\nThe 2003 event was disrupted by a defrocked priest, Cornelius Horan , who ran onto the Hangar Straight\nduring the race while cars were coming  at him at over 260 km/h (160 mph). Marshals were able to get\nhim off the track before he hurt himse lf or anyone else and he was later arrested; Brazilian Rubens\nBarrichello won the race for Ferrari. A dispute between Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers'\nClub  (BRDC), and the Formula One authori ties in 2003 over the funding of necessary improvements to\nthe track's facilities led to doubts over the future of the race.

The track instituted a 'dynamic pricing' model of prices refreshing every 90 seconds based on\ndemand, and then encouraged fans to access its online ticketing system immediately after sales began.\nThe rush of fans led to surges in pricing and crashes to the ticket sales website.
