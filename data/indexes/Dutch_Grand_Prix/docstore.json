The road\nwas later connected to other roads opening access coastal\ndefence positions.[1]\nAfter the war some of these roads were widened and\nlinked together and a racing circuit was designed, not as\nlegend has it by John Hugenholtz , but rathe r by a group of\nofficials from the Royal Dutch Motorcycle Association,\nwith advice from Bentley Boy Sammy Davis , who had\nwon the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1927 . The first race took\nplace in 1950 .[1] The edition, along with the 1951  event,\nwas held as non-championship Formul a One races, with\nLouis Rosier  winning both years.\n1952  was the year the Dutch Grand Prix was part of the\nthird Formula One World Championship ; this and the next\nyear's races were won by Italian Alberto Ascari .

The 1956 and 1957 races were cancelled because of apparent lack of money , which was\nindirectly caused by the 1956\u20131957 Suez Crisis. The 1958 Dutc h Grand Prix was won by Moss  in a\nVanwall . 1959  saw Swede Jo Bonnier  win his only Formula One championship event and 1960  saw Dan\nGurney  have an accident and a spectator was killed; the race was won by Jack Brabham  in a Cooper .\nFrom 1963  to 1965  saw Brito n Jim Clark win all three events , and 1967  saw the introduction of the Lotus\n49 with its brand new Ford- Cosworth DFV  engine. The DFV  won on its debut with Clark driving; this\nengine became the most successful and widely used engine among private teams until 1985. The 1970\nevent saw the 49's successor , the 72, win comprehensively with Jochen Rindt  behind the wheel. However ,\ntragedy struck during the race: Briton Piers Cour age, driving for Frank Williams , crashed heavily near the\nnotoriously fast Tunnel Oost corner after a wheel came off and hit him on the head, which killed him. The\ncar, with Courage still in it, then caught fire and burned to the ground. The 1971  event saw Jacky Ickx\nwin in a Ferrari  after a spirited battle with Mexican Pedro Rodriguez  in a BRM  in rain-soaked conditions.\nThere was no 1972 race. It was origin ally on that year's calendar , but the drivers refused to race at\nZandvoort, because the facilities and conditions of the circuit were out-of-date with Grand Prix racing at\nthat time.\nZandvoort had been extensively modified during its absence from the Grand Prix calendar . It had been\nlined with Armco  and the cars were protected from the sand dunes and track-side obstacles. New pits\nwere built, and the circuit also saw a chicane placed before Bosuit, the very high-speed corner that went\ninto the pit-straight. For the 1973  race, in an indirect celebration of the efforts put forth, there was a\nspecial atmosphere at that weekend and everyone was happy , especially the organizers. But in a cruel\ntwist of fate, that race was to be yet another black mark on Zandvoort's history and reputation. In a race\nthat was thought to be one of the most well organized Grands Prix yet seen, it was actually\ndisor ganization and a total lack of clear communication that would be ultimately responsible for what\nwas to happen. On the eighth lap of the race, Briton Roger Williamson  (in only his second ever Formula\nOne race) crashed heavily near Tunnel Oost and his car caught fire while scraping along the tarmac.\nWilliamson was uninjured during the crash; but time was running out; he could not free himself from the\ncar. Williamson's countryman David Purley  stopped alongside, crossed the track and ran over to the\nburning March. Purley tried in vain to turn the car upright. There appeared to have been ample time to\nright the car and pull Williamson out, but as desperately as he tried, Purley was unable to do it by himself,\nand the marshals, who were not wearing flame retardant  overalls , were unable and unwilling to help due\nto the intense heat. Race control assumed that it was Purley's car that had crash ed and that the driver had\nescaped unharmed. Many drivers who saw Purley waving them down to stop assumed that he was trying\nto put a fire out from  his own car, having safely exited it, and thus did not know that a second driver had\nbeen invol ved. As a result, the race continued at full pace while Purley desperately tried to save the life of\nWilliamson. Due to a group of race officials standing around Williamson's burning car doing absolutely\nnothing to help and even hindering the situation (by throwing away the fire extinguisher Purley was using\nover the Armco and down a slope), this did not work, and Williamson died not of skin burns but of\nasphyxiation.

Andretti attempted ambitiously to pass Hunt at the\n180-degree Tarzan corner; the two cars touched and both were out of the race. Andretti won the 1978\nrunning; his last Formula One victory . 1979  saw a change to the circuit to slow cars coming into Tunnel\nOost; there was a high-speed temporary  chicane put there. Canadian Gilles Villeneuve  had crash ed there\nwhile battling feroc iously with Australian Alan Jones and damaged his left-rear suspension. Though he\ncarried on, at the start of the next lap he went off again at Tarzan. Refusing to give up, Villeneuve, to the\nshock of many , went into reverse gear and drove his Ferrari out of the muddy run-of f area and back onto\nthe circuit. About halfway around the next lap, the car's left rear rim, wheel, and suspension totally\nshattered and was dragged by the car as it went along, making the Ferrari nearly impossible to drive.\nVilleneuve, displaying his now legendary car control, made it back to the pits without crashing or going\noff and retired from the race; the Grand Prix was won by Jones. 1980  saw the chicane removed and\nreplaced by a slower chicane before Tunnel Oost. 1981  saw a big battle between Frenchman Alain Prost\nin a Renault  and Jones in a Williams ; Prost came out on top to win. The 1982  event was won by\nFrenchman Didier Pironi  in a Ferrari; his countryman Ren\u00e9 Arnoux  had a dreadful crash at the end of the\npit straight going into Tarzan; his front suspension failed on his ground-ef fect Renault and he went head\non into the barriers; fortunately he was uninjured. 1983  saw a battle betwee n championship contenders\nProst and Brazilian Nelson Piquet. Prost attempted to pass Piquet at Tarzan but the Frenchman punted\nPiquet off and Prost crashed soon afterwards. Prost won from pole in 1984 . In 1985 , Lauda took his 25th\nand final Grand Prix victory while holding off his charging McLaren  teammate Prost near the end of the\nrace.\n1985 was the race's final running, as the company that ran the circuit (CENA V) went out of business,\nmarking the end of the old Zandvoort circuit. The track, owned by the municipality of Zandvoort, was not\nused for some time and part of the grounds and approximately half of the track was sold in 1987 to\nVendorado, a bungalow park developer at that time.[3] The track  was eventually redesigned and is still\nused for other disciplines of motorsport.\nOn 14 May 2019, the Dutch Grand Prix at the Zandvoort track was announced for the 2020  Formula One\ncalendar .[4] In March 2020 the return of event was postponed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic ; it\nwas later cancelled altogether with the event's return slated for 2021 , where home favourite Max\nVerstappen  took the victory . Verstappen won the 2022 and 2023 races, with his streak of pole positions\nand victories at the Grand Prix since its return in 2021 being broken in 2024  with Lando Norris  both\ntaking pole and winning the race.
