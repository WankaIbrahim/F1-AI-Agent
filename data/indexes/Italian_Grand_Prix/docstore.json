Since 2013, it has been the Grand Prix\nheld the most times,  with 93 editions as of 2023 . It\nis one of the two Grands Prix (along with the\nBritish ) which has run as an event of the Formula\nOne World Championship Grands Prix every\nseason, continuously  since the championship was\nintroduced in 1950. Every Formula One Italian\nGrand Prix in the World Championsh ip era has\nbeen held at Monza  except in 1980 , when it was\nheld at Imola .\nThe Italian Grand Prix counted toward  the World\nManufacturers' Championship  from 1925 to 1928\nand toward the European Championship  from\n1931 to 1932 and from 1935 to 1938. It was\nadditionally designated the European Grand Prix\nseven times betwee n 1923 and 1967, when this\ntitle was an honorary designation given  each year\nto one Grand Prix race in Europe. Four editions\nbefore the World Championship were held in\nplaces other than Monza: Montichiari  (1921 ),\nLivorno  (1937 ), Milan  (1947 ) and Turin (1948 ).\nThe event is due to take place at the Monza Circuit\nuntil at least 2025.[1]\nThe first Italian Grand Prix took place on 4 September 1921 at a 10.7-mile (17.3 km) circuit near\nMontichiari .[2] How ever, the race is more closely associated with the course at Monza , a racing facility\njust outside the northern city of Milan , Italy's second largest city in its largest metropolitan area, its\neconomic capital and Alfa Romeo's home.

Monza was built in the Parco di Monza , a public city park with a largely woodland\nsetting, where the famous Royal Villa of Monza  is also located.\nThe Autodromo Naziona le di Monza  was completed in\n1922 and was just the third permanent autodrome in the\nworld at that time; Brooklands in England and\nIndianapolis in the United States were the two others.\nEuropean motor racing pioneers Vincenzo Lancia  and\nFelice Nazzaro  laid the last two bricks at Monza. The\ncircuit was 10 km (6.25 miles) long, with a flat banked\nsection and a road circuit combined into one. It was\nfast, and always provided excitement. The 1923 race\nincluded one of Harry A. Miller 's rare European\nappearances with his single seat \"Ameri can Miller 122\"\ndriven by Count Louis Zborowski  of Chitty Chitty\nBang Bang  fame. Zborowski was killed at the\nfollowing year's Grand Prix at Monza driving a Mercedes.\nThe 1928 race was the first of many tragedies that\nbefell this venue. Italians Emilio Materassi  in a Talbot\nand Giulio Foresti in a Bugatti were battling around the\nfast circuit. As they came off the banking onto the left\nside of the pit straig ht at 125 mph (200 km/h), one of\nthe front wheels of Materassi's overtaking Talbot\ntouched one of the rear wheels of the Bugatti. Materassi\nlost contro l of the car, swerved left, cleared a 15-foot\nwide and 10-foot deep ditch and ploughed into the\nunprotected grandstand opposite the pits, killing\nhimself and 27 spectators, and injuring another 26. It\nwas the worst accident in motor racing history and\nremained so until the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans . The\nItalian Grand Prix went on a three-year hiatus (but the\nalternative non-championship Monza Grand Prix was run in 1929 and 1930) until the 1931 race, held in\nlate May instead of the traditional early  September , was won by Giuseppe Campari  and Tazio Nuvolari,\nsharing an Alfa Romeo. The 1931 race was something of an endurance race; it took ten hours to\ncomplete. The great Nuvolari won again in a shortened 1932 race , this time held in early June.\nIn 1933 , with the race being  held this time at the traditional timeframe of early September , disaster struck\nagain. Three top drivers were killed during the course of the Monza Grand Prix, a Formula Libre race\nheld over three heats and a final in the afternoon of 10 September , after the Italian Grand Prix itself had\nbeen held in the morning, on what became known as the \"Black Day of Monza\".[3] During the second\nheat, there was a reported patch of oil on the south banking that had come from a Duesenber g, driven byAutodromo Nazionale di Monza\nThe black day of 1933", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2809, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a379c63-5bb6-452a-873d-390ed442da32": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a379c63-5bb6-452a-873d-390ed442da32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a16cd1d2-e111-4269-a8f8-ba7c9f132efc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "fe6b508fe88dbe2b676e37c43a7f992c30150135316b72d8df0a21704e52ce24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1933 posterCount Carlo Felice Trossi , and Giuseppe Cam pari in a Ferrari-\nentered Alfa Romeo and his protege Baconin Borzacchini  in a\nMaserati were already battling ferociously; and Borzacchini and\nCampari went through the south banking on the first lap, wheel to\nwheel. Borzacchini went through the oily patch, lost control, spun\nwildly and the Maserati then overturned and violently flipped\nmultiple times, and by the time the wrecked car came to a stop,\nBorzacchini was pinned underneath and was being crushed by his\ncar, not having been  thrown out. And while Borzacchini's Maserati\nhad been crashing all over the track, Campari swerved to avoid\nhim, and by doing this, his car went up and flew off the banking\nand crashed into trees situated right next to the track. Campari\nbroke his neck and was killed instantly , and Borzacchini died later\nthat day in a Monza hospital.\nPrior to the final, there was a drivers meeting to discuss the oil\npatch, and it was decided to clean it up. On the eighth lap, Polish\naristocrat Count Stanislas Czaykowski  was on the south banking\nwhen his Bugatti's engine blew up, and a fuel line then broke. The fuel from the Bugatti's tank caught fire\nafter touch ing the very hot front section of the Bugatti where the engine and gearbox were and the\nburning fuel sprayed onto Czaykowski. Blinded by the smoke and flames on him, he went up and flew off\nthe banking- at the same spot where Campari and Borzacchini had crashed. The Polish driver , unable to\nput out the flames on his body which was fuelled by the fuel from his wrecke d Bugatti, then burned to\ndeath. Frenchman Marcel Lehoux  in a Bugatti  was declared the winner of the shortened event.[3]\nEnzo Ferrari , who had been close to Campari and Borzacchini; the former deciding to defect from\nFerrari's team to Maserati, became hardened by this tragedy . Today , racing historians conclude that the\nevents of this race marked a watershed, notably for Enzo Ferrari. It was the end to the joyful era of racing\nand the beginning of a harsher new age. Safety in those days was completely non-existent. The circuit's\ncondition was virtually identical of that to an ordinary town and country road, except instead of the\nsurface being made of dirt and/or tarmac, it was made of tarmac, concrete and/or bricks. Spectators often\nstood very close to or even next to the track and they had no protection of any kind other than common\nsense. What was particularly tragic about the 41-year old Campari's death was that he had announced his\nretirement at the French Grand Prix two months earlier , to focus on his opera singing exploits.[4]\nAfter the disastrous  1933 race, somethi ng had to be done to Monza. In 1934 a short version of Florio\nCircuit (introduced in 1930 for Monza  Grand Prix) was used: the drivers had to start from the main\nstraight but taking the south curve of the high speed ring (interrupted by a doubl e chicane) in the opposite\ndirection compared to the usual one; then, through the connection introduced a few years before by\nFlorio, they took the central straight, the south curve (also interrupted by a chica ne) and the main straight;\nfinally a 180 \u00b0 hairpin turned back to the finish line. This configuration was considered too slow and\nsince the following year Florio circuit (with five chicanes) was used. These races were at a time when\nMercedes and Auto Union became involved in motor racing; the German Silver Arrows won all of these\nraces; with superstar Rudolf Caracciola  winning in 1934  and in 1937  when the Italian Grand Prix wasThe Florio circuit and other locations", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3593, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1eae33c-684d-49a1-ba4a-c749a5da6996": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1eae33c-684d-49a1-ba4a-c749a5da6996", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b1261a93-d9f7-471c-9f7f-5a28ef45515b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Italian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "0bd3d8c0fee8dc08f0d4203142cbf7cea14ddca3a2b329f418c9035d04fb76cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1953 GP race startheld at a street circuit in Livorno. 1938  saw a return to Monza, which was won by Nuvolari driving a\nmid-engined Auto Union; just after the race renovation works began but in 1939 World War II broke out\nand the Italian Grand Prix did not return until 1947.\n1947  saw the Italian Gran d Prix being held at a fairgrounds park in the city of Milan 's district of Portello ,\nand this race was won by Italian Carlo Felice Trossi driving an Alfa Romeo. Italian Giovanni Bracco\nwent off the road in his Delage  and crash ed into a group of spectators, killing five. This venue was never\nused again  for racing, and 1948  saw it being held in Valentino Park, a public park in Turin. The 1949 race\nreturned to Monza where it stayed for the next 30 years with the configuration ready before the war but\nnever used yet.\nMonza's banking had been built over and only the road circuit was used, which had been modified\nslightly . The new long, fluid final corner was now two around 90-degree corners. 1949 saw Italian new-\nboy Alberto Ascari , son of the late 1924 Italia n Grand Prix winner Antonio Ascari , win in his Ferrari;\nEnzo Ferrari was now building his own cars instead of running Alfa Romeos. 1950  saw the new Formula\nOne Championship being established. The race and the first championship was won by Giuseppe \"Nino\"\nFarina , driving a superchar ged Alfa Romeo 158. 1951  saw Ascari win again, after the competitive Alfas\nof Farina and Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio  ran into engine problems. 1952  saw Asca ri complete his\ndomination of that season. 1953  Fangio won in a Maserati; although Ascari had already won the\nchampionship at the Swiss Grand Prix. 1954  turned out to be an interesting race; as up-and-comer Stirling\nMoss  in a Maserati passed both Fangio's Mercedes and Ascari's Ferrari. The furious pace saw the\nretirement of Moss and Ascari and Fangio went on to win while Moss pushed his Maserati 250F  over the\nline.\nAfter the 1954 running, work began on entirely\nrevamping the circuit. New facilities were built and a\nnew corner , the Parabolica, was built right before the\npits. Extra track used for a short course was eliminated.\nThe biggest change was the construction of the new\nMonza banking. Built on top of where the almost flat,\nnarrow original banking was, these huge concrete\nbankings, called the sopraelevata  curves, were built in\nthe same shape as the original banking had been. The\nonly significant difference was that the Curva Sud was\nmoved slightly to the north. This course was combined\nwith the road course  for the 1955 event , which was won\nby Fangio and was the last race contested by a full-\nfledged Mercedes factory effort in Form ula One until 2010. The 10 km Monza circuit was now so fast\nthat F1 cars were averaging 135+ mph per lap- though rather unremarkable by today's standards, these\naverage speeds were even faster than the Indianapolis Speedway oval in the United States. 1956  saw an\nexciting race, with championship contenders Fangio, Briton Peter Collins  (both in Ferraris)  and\nFrenchman Jean Behra  in a Maserati fight over the win. Stirling Moss was already out of championship\ncontention; and Fangio retired with a broken steering arm. The Ferrari team called for Italian Luigi\nMusso  to hand his car over to Fangio. Musso ignored the order so Collins came in and handed his car and\nhis championship chances to Fangio.

Moss was able to refuel his car and storm off after Musso\nand eventually the Italian retired with steering problems, and Moss, with Fangio catching him up fast,\nstormed round the track to take victory . Fangio took second and his fourth Drivers' Championship.\n1957  saw the organizers choose to use the road circuit only, as the rough, poorly constructed banking had\ncaused problems for the Ferrari and Maserati cars the year before. Moss won again in a Vanwall, and\nBriton Tony Brooks won next year's race, and Moss won the 1959  event in a Cooper -Climax. 1960 ,\nhowever was not so straightforward. Ferrari with their front-engined cars, had lost out to the advanced\nmid-engined British cars. Seeing an opportunity , the Italian organizers decided to re-include the banking\nwith the road circuit, making Monza even faster and more in favour to the powerful Ferraris. The British\nteams were unhappy  as they cited the fragility of the banking, which was extremely rough, had a concrete\nsurface instead of asphalt, was of very poor quality and was supported by stilts rather than solid bedrock;\nthe argument being that it was too dangerous for Formula One cars. The British teams boycotted the race,\nso Ferrari had no competition. American Phil Hill took victory , in what was the last victory for a front-\nengined Formula One car .\n1961  saw a return to the combined circuit, but it was to see yet another tragedy . Two Ferrari drivers, Hill\nand German count Wolfgang von Trips, came into the race with a chance at winning the championship.\nFighting for fourth place while Hill was leading and while von Trips approached the Parabolica, the\nBriton Jim Clark  slightly moved over into the path of the German and the two collided. Von Trips crashed\ninto an embankment next to the road and then went flying into a crowd of people standing on it. Von\nTrips was thrown out of his car and was killed, as were 14 spectators. Clark survived but was hounded by\nItalian police for months after the incident. Hill won the race and the champi onship by one point. The\nrace was not stopped, allegedly to assist rescue work for the injured.\n1962  saw a return to the road circuit only and the\nbanking was never used again for Formula One. It still\nstands, but in decrepit condition for a long time before\nbeing restored in the early 2010s; the last time it was\nused was in 1969 for the 1000 kilometre sports car race\nthat year. Briton Graham Hill won the race, and won\nthe Drivers' Championship in South Africa soon\nafterward. 1963  saw an attempted use of the extremely\nfast full circuit again, and the drivers ran the course\nduring Friday practice but the concrete banking was so\nrough and bumpy that cars were being mechanically\ntorn apart. It was feared that there would be no finishers\nfor the race itself. Briton Bob Anderson 's Lola crashed after losing a wheel on the banking, although he\nwas not injured); the drivers then threatened to walk off unless they raced on the road circuit only, which\nis what happened. Jim Clark won the race in a Lotus. Ferrari driver John Surtees  won in 1964 , and Brito n\nJackie Stewart  won his first of 27 Grand Prix victories in 1965 , driving for BRM. Against team orders, he\nfought hard with his teammate Graham Hill, Hill made a mistake at the Parab olica and Stewart was in\ncommand; this was all to the chagrin of team boss Tony Rudd . 1966  saw Italian Ludovico Scarfiotti  win,\nand no other Italian has won the race since. 1967  was to be a race of interest and was to produce the first\nof three close finishe s on the fast Monza circuit over the next four years.

Stewart came out on top and\nbeat Rindt by eight- hundredths of a second. The four drivers were all within two-tenths of a second of\neach other . With this win, Stewart won his first of three championships. 1970  saw Rind t's fatal crash\nduring qualifying at the wheel of his rear wing-less Lotus; his car suffered brake shaft failure, veered off\nthe track, hit and went under the improperly-secured guardrail on the left and spun multiple times. Rindt\ndied not because of the impact but because he had not properly secured his seat belts and the buckle had\nslit his throat. Rindt  became the only posthumous World Champion, after Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx failed\nto overhaul Rindt. Ickx's teammate Clay Regazzoni  won the race, which saw 28 lead changes. 1971  was\nto see the third close finish in four years.

Cevert and Hailwood finished within two-tenths and Ganley\nwas half a second behind.\n1972  saw changes to Mon za. The 1971 race was the fastest Formula One race ever at that point in time. It\nwas really just a bunch of straights and fast corners and F1 cars had become increasingly advanced and\nmuch faste r, and the drivers were constantly slipstreaming each other around the circuit. A small chicane\nwas put at the end of the pit straight and another one at the Vialone curve; Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi\nwon that race and his first Drivers' Championship at only 25 years of age. His chief rival Jackie Stewart\nwent out at the start with a broken gearbox. In 1973 , Stewart punctured a tire early in the race and went\ninto the pits to have  it changed; he came out in 20th place and finished fourth in the race while Fittipaldi\nfinished second; this was enough for Stewart to win his third and final Drivers' Championship. 1974  saw\nfurther changes with the Vialone chicane changed and renamed Variante Ascari, which was the place\nwhere Alberto Ascari was killed in 1955 testing a Ferrari sportscar . Like the year before, Peterson won\nand Fittipaldi finished second, now driving for McLaren. 1975 , however , was an event to remember .\nFerrari, which had regrouped completely under the leadership of Luca di Montezemo lo, reached the high\npoint of its resur gence.\nThe Ferrari camp was feeling relaxed while rising star\nand championship leader Niki Lauda  was leading the\nDrivers' Champions hip, and the team was leading the\nConstructors' Championship. Fittipaldi and Argentine\nCarlos Reutemann  had to win in order to have a chance\nat staying in the championship chase.

Peterson had crash ed his car in practice, and had to use Andretti's spare car, not a\ncomfortable fit for the tall Swede, in contrast to the diminutive American. As the race started, there was a\nhuge, fiery multi-car pile-up on the approach to the first corner . One of the victims was Peterson; his car\nslammed head-on into the Armco barriers and had caught fire. Instead of the ill-equipped marshals,\nBriton James Hunt, with the help of Frenchman Patrick Depailler  and Regazzoni ran towards Peterson's\naid and pulled him out of the burning Lotus. Peterson suffered severe leg injuries, and he died from\nembolism complicat ions a day later. With Peterson's retirement from the race, Andretti won the Drivers'\nChampionship.

Scheckter , now\ndriving for Ferrari, won the race and the Drivers' Championship.\nIn 1979, it was announced that the Autodromo Dino Ferrari, also known as Imola, would host the Italian\nGrand Prix for 1980  while Monza underwent a major upgrade, including building a new pit complex. The\nImola circuit had been used for a non-championship event in 1979 and had hosted a variety of non-\nchampionship races since 1953; this circuit was closer to the Ferrari factory in Maranello. Imola's one-\ntime running of the Italian GP was won by Brazilian Nelson Piquet  after the two turbo Renaults of Jean-\nPierre Jabouille  and Ren\u00e9 Arnoux  retired.\nThe Italian  Grand Prix returned to Monza for 1981, and\nit has stayed there ever since. The Imola circuit was not\nto leave Formula One, it hosted the San Marino Grand\nPrix from 1981 to 2006. The 1981 Italian Grand Prix\nwas won by rising star Alain Prost, and that race saw\nBriton John Watson  have  a huge accident at the second\nLesmo Curve which also took out Italian Michele\nAlboreto.
