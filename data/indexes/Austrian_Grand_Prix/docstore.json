It\nreturned to the Formula One calendar in 2014 , where it has remained since then. It was first held at the\nZeltweg Air Base  for its first, non-Championship running. Since 1970, the race has been held at the\n\u00d6sterreichring, currently known as the Red Bull Ring  due to its owners hip by the Austrian drinks\ncompany of the same name . Ever since it returned to the calendar , the Austrian Grand Prix is typically\nheld during the mid-season rounds of the Formula One World Championship, with one exception: the\nAustrian Grand Prix was held as the season opener in 2020 , due to the impact  of the COVID-19\npandemic  and subsequent lockdowns disrupting the season. Also in 2020, an additional race, held also at\nthe Red Bull Ring, was added to the calendar called the Styrian Grand Prix, which was held twice,\nfacilitating a double-header to maximise the number of Grands Prix during seasons that were affected by\nthe pandemic.\nThe Austrian Grand Prix has been held at two different locations in southeastern  Austria , being originally\nheld in Zeltweg , about 70 km (43 mi) west of Graz . Since 1969 the Austrian Grand Prix has taken place\nin neighbouring Spielber g, with the two venues being within approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) of each\nother .[1] It was first held at the Zeltweg Air Base  for six years, before  a permanent track,  originally called\nthe \u00d6sterreichring  and later known as the A-1 ring and Red Bull Ring, was built.\nA non-championship event was held in 1963 at a race track  on the Zeltweg Airfield  and it was won by\nAustralian Jack Brabham . The first champio nship event took place in the following year, and Italian\nLorenzo Bandini won his only Formula One championship race in a Ferrari. The race was a success, but\nthe track was deemed too dangerous; it was narrow and very bumpy , and spectators complained of poor\nviewing areas.

It was built in the scenic Styrian mountains and it was a fast, flowing track\nwhere every corner  was high speed and long. The Austrian Grand Prix was designated the European\nGrand Prix once , 1975, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix\nrace in Europe. The very fast track was popular with drivers, and the events were moderately successful.\nThe first race on this track was dominated by Ferrari, with their more powerful Flat-12 engines enabled\nthem to be 10 mph faster \u2013 which is a lot in racing terms. The 1971 race saw Swiss driver Jo Siffert\ndominate in his BRM  and Briton Jackie Stewart  took his second Drivers' Championship . The 1975 event\nwas marred by the fatal accident of Ame rican Mark Donohue , and the race itself was rain-soaked and was\nwon by Vittorio Brambilla , winning the only F1 race of his career , and, true to form, he crashed into the\nguardrail and broke the nose of his car shortly after crossing the finish line when the race was stopped\nearly because the rain got worse (althou gh the race started after 1 hour and 15 minutes of delay , due the\nheavy rain, with the drivers doing extra practice during this time). In 1976, home favourite Niki Lauda 's\nappalling crash at the N\u00fcrbur gring caused him to miss the race, which was won by Briton John Watson in\nthe short-lived Penske F1 team, winning his first Formula One race (and Penske's only win in the\ncategory).\n1976 had seen the Voest-Hugel corner changed slightly into one corner instead of two corners; but 1977\nsaw a slow three-corner chicane install ed at Voest-Hugel, which was where Donohue had crashed two\nyears before. What was the fastest corner on the track was now the slowest  corner there and would\nbecome known as the Hella-Licht Chicane. This race was won by Australian Alan Jones  in a Shadow; and\nlike with Brambilla and Watson, it was his first Grand Prix victory . 1978 saw the dominant Lotus 79s on\nthe front row, and American Mario Andretti  crashed at the Glatz Kurve on the first lap, and his teammate,\nSwede Ronnie Peter son took victory . 1979 started to show the superiority of turbo-char ged engines on\nthis fast and high-altitude circuit. Although Jones won again in a Williams, Jean-Pierre Jabouille and\nRene Arno ux in their Renaults were able to dominate this event and also the following year's race, which\nJabouille won. 1981 saw three turbo-char ged cars dominate the front row; and into the race, the immense\npower and dreadful handling of Didier Pironi's Ferrari helped him to hold up four better handling cars and\nget into a five-way battle for third place, which went on for a while but the four cars eventually passed\nhim, one of which was Jacques Laffite who went on to win the race. 1982 saw a spectacular show in\nwhich five turbochar ged cars dominat ed the grid; all but one of these cars retired with mechanical\nproblems, including  Italian Riccardo Patrese  who had a spectac ular accident at the Texaco Bends, and\nFrenchman Alain Prost  whose engine expired with a few laps to go while in the lead.
