Historica lly, Japan has been\none of the last races of the season, and as such the\nJapanese Grand Prix has been the venue for many\ntitle-deciding races , with 13 World Drivers'\nChampions  being crowned over the 36 World\nChampionship Japanese Grands Prix that have\nbeen hosted. Japan was the only Asian nation to\nhost a Formula One race (including the Pacific\nGrand Prix) until Malaysia joined the calendar in\n1999 .\nThe first two Formula One Japanese Grands Prix\nin 1976 and 1977 were held at the Fuji Speedway ,\nbefore Japan was taken off the calendar . It\nreturned in 1987 at Suzuka, which hosted the\nGrand Prix exclusively for 20 years and gained a\nreputation as one of the most challengin g Formula\nOne circuits. In 1994 and 1995, Japan also hosted\nthe Pacific Grand Prix at the TI Circuit , making\nJapan one of only nine countries to host more than\none Grand Prix in the same season (the others\nbeing Austria , Bahrain , France , Germany , Great\nBritain , Italy, Spain  and the USA ). In 2007 the\nGrand Prix moved back to the newly redesigned\nFuji Speedway .[1] After a second race at Fuji in\n2008, the race return ed to Suzuka in 2009, as part\nof an alternating agreement between the owners of\nFuji Speedway and Suzuka Circuit, perennial\nrivals Toyota  and Honda . How ever, in July 2009,\nToyota announced it would not host the race at\nFuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond due to a\ndownturn in the global economy ,[2] and so the\nJapanese Grand Prix was held at Suzuka instead.\nSuzuka has hosted the Japanese Grand Prix every\nyear since 2009, apart from in 2020 and 2021 when the Grands Prix were cancelled due to the COVID-19\npandemic .[3][4]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2434, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a12b6f04-39a8-410e-9d45-d2d45c02ff54": {"__data__": {"id_": "a12b6f04-39a8-410e-9d45-d2d45c02ff54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ddbd492-f90d-4b6f-aef3-309e8fbde29b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "ca75fea3bb82e8b82c3c8d3712b6bfb97e1410535e6c224db7838eddaabed434", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Prince R380 (1966)\nNiki Lauda's Ferrari 312T2\n(1976)\nRonnie Peterson's Tyrrell P34\n(1977)The event is due to take place at the Suzuka Circuit until at least 2029.[5]\nThe first Japanese Grand Prix was run as a sports car race[6] at the Suzuka\nCircuit  80 kilome tres (50 mi) south west of Nagoya  in May 1963. In 1964,\nthe race was held at Suzuka again. This marked the beginning of motor\nracing in earnest in Japan. For the next eight installments, however , the\nnon-championship Grand Prix was run at the Fuji Speedway , 40 miles\n(64 km) west of Yokohama  and 66 miles (106 km) west of the Japanese\ncapital of Tokyo . At the time, the circuit (which was actually an incomplete\ncircuit) featured Daiichi, the opening banked turn, which was the scene of\nmany fatal accidents (removed in 1974). It was then run as a number of disciplines of motorsports,\nparticularly Formula 2, sports cars and Can-Am -type sprint racing.\nThe first Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix, in 1976, was held at the very fast\n2.7-mile Fuji Speedway , minus the banking. The race was to become\nfamous for the title decider between James Hunt and Niki Laud a as it was\nheld durin g monsoon  condition s. Lauda, who had survived a near-fatal\ncrash at the German Grand Prix earlier in the seaso n, withdrew from the\nrace stating that his life was more important than the championship, as did\nBrazilians Emerson Fittipaldi  and Carlos Pace . The torrential rain\neventually stopped, and after a slow pit stop that put him down to 5th, Hunt\ndrove hard and climbed up to 3rd, taking the 4 points he needed to win the\ntitle by the slender  margin of one point over Lauda.

It immediately saw another World Title decided, as Nigel\nMansell  crashed his William s-Honda heavily in practice at the Snake Esses and consequ ently could not start\nthe race due to aggravating an old back injury he had received in his Formula Ford days, effectively handing\nthe title to his teammate Nelson Piquet ; the 3rd and final title of his career . Austrian Gerhard Berger won the\nrace for Ferrari, their first victory since 1985.\nSuzuka played a part in the feud between Frenchman Alain Prost and\nBrazilian Ayrton Senna . This long battle reached immense levels of\ncontroversy and media coverage; this struggle was between two men who\nwere both considered to be by far the best drivers in Formula One at that\ntime.\nThe 1988 race was a World Championship decider between Senna and Prost\n\u2013 who were McLaren teammates that year. Senna came in with a greater\nchance of winning the championship, as the points system in those days\ncounted the best 11 results; Senna had retired from one more Grand Prix\nthan Prost had and had been slightly less consistent than the Frenchman, yet\nthis was actually to the Brazilian's advantage; the way the points system worked in those days meant that\nthere was more room for him to score points. McLaren also had obtained superior and fuel-ef ficient Honda\nengines from Williams, had a car far better than any of the others, and had won every race of the season\nexcept the Italian Grand Prix \u2013 McLare n's only double retirement of the season. At the start, Senna made a\nvery bad start, stalli ng on the grid but then managing to bump-start his car on the down-sloping pit straight.\nAs a result, he dropped to 14th, while Prost took the lead. It then began to rain, and wet-weather specialist\nSenna stormed around the track, setting  a number of fastest laps and passing car after car until he caught\nBerger in 2nd and then started to catch Prost rapidly . The Frenchman's gearbox was malfunctioning, and the\nBrazilian caught and passed Prost while the Frenchman was delayed by consistent backmarker Andrea de\nCesaris. Senna won the race and his first Drivers' Championship with Prost finishing 2nd, despite the latter\nscoring more points overall.\nThe 1989 race was a highly anticipated race, and even with new regulations banning turbo-char ged engines,\nthe McLaren-Honda  combination was still dominant, they had won 10 of 14 races so far in the season. This\nrace turned  out to be one of the most memorable in the sport's history . Prost and Senna, once again McLaren\nteammates for 1989, were both embroile d in an acrimonious personal feud that had started at the second race\nof the season  and their relationsh ip was, come the race weekend, at such a low point it was virtually non-\nexistent. Very unusual for teammates of a racing team, there was almost zero communication going on\nbetween Prost and Senna, and was to the degree where the McLaren team were effectively running as 2\nseparate teams \u2013 with 4 to 5 times more people around Senna than Prost. This was because Senna had a\ncloser relationship with the Honda engin eers than Prost; Senna's popularity with the Japanese public thanks\nto his flat-out drivi ng style benefited Honda in many different ways; and McLaren wanted a long-term\npartnership with Honda, as their engines  were better than all the others. Both Senna and Prost went into the\nrace week end each knowing what the stakes were. Prost was 16 points ahead of Senna, and the Brazilian\nwas facing  nearly insurmountable odds: he had to win at Suzuka to stand any chance of staying in contention\nof winning the championship going into the next race, which he was obliged to win as well.

As the starting lights flashed to green, Prost made an excellent start and jumped into\nthe fast first corner ahead of Senna. The two McLaren drivers immediately started to pull away from the rest\nof the field, with Prost and Senna setting the pace at the highest possible level they could muster . On lap 47,\ngoing through the ultra-fast 130R corner, the Brazilian attempted an ambitious pass going into the Casio\nchicane. Senna was in an awkward position to pass, being on the inside of his teammate, and tried to shove\nhis way past Prost, but the Frenchman decided to be true to words he had said to Senna and McLaren boss\nRon Dennis : he would  not leave the door open as he had before and give up the position simply for McLaren\nto be emba rrassed by a double retiremen t. And Prost did exactly that: as he turned into the right handed turn\nthat made up the first part of the chicane, he turned into Senna, and the Frenchman's car hit the Brazilian's\ncar and the two cars were interlocked and both slid off the track and up the chicane's escape road, the Honda\nV10 engines in both cars stalling.\nProst and Senna were both beached and Prost got out of his car promptly , knowing he had won the\nchampionship with Senna's apparent retirement whilst Senna waved towards a group of Suzuka's track\nmarshals, who ran up to the two interlocked cars. So they could separate the two cars, the marshals pushed\nSenna's car backwar ds onto the track, which put it in a dangerous position. The marshals then pushed his car\nforwards while Senna bump-started the engine, and he drove off. Even after being stalled for more than 30\nseconds, the furious pace he and Prost had been running at put them both so far ahead of the rest of the field\nthat Senna was still leading the race comfortably in front of Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini . Senna's\nfront nose cone was damaged and going through the Degner bend, it came off; and he pitted to have it\nchanged. Nannini had passed Senna while the Brazilian was in the pits, and after he stormed out of the pits,\nSenna drove as furiously as he had before, and within 2 laps while making up 2.5 seconds a lap on Nannini\nhe caught and passed the Italian cleanly at the Casio chicane. Senna took the chequered flag, but the podium\nceremony proceeded to be delayed. A meeting between Senna, Prost, the McLaren management and FIA\nofficials including the very unpopular FIA and FISA  president Jean-Marie Balestre  took place immediately\npost-race. It was thought that Senna was going to be disqualified for receiving external non-team assistance,\nwhich was against the rules, but that rule had a loophole: the rule read that if a driver was deemed to be in a\ndangerous position,  they could be push started. But much to almost the entire Formula One paddock's\nastonishment, it was deemed that Senna was to be disqualified for bypassing the chicane and the marked\ntrack after making his way down an escape road bordering the circuit. Cutting the chicane was in effect\nbypassing the track to gain an advantage \u2013 and this was illegal. But this rule was not enforced and generally\nignored in those days if a driver was negatively affected in terms of where they stood in the race \u2013 which\nSenna was not. Nevertheless, the Brazilian Senna was infuriated by the decisio n \u2013 and he later said that he\nstruggled to cope for a long time with what happened.

As shown in a\nvideo of the pre-rac e drivers' briefing,[9] the driver s were discussing what was to be done if a car was in a\ndangerous position at the Casio Chicane. Senna was appalled at what he saw as a ridiculous interpretation of\nbadly thought-out rules \u2013 and he walked  out of the meeting as it was taking place. Senna qualified on pole\nposition, three-tenths ahead of Prost, now driving for Ferrari, who had the next most competitive package\nthat year behind McLaren. Senna requested to change the grid positions in order to move pole position to the\ncleaner left side of the road, where the racing line was. This was granted, but Balestre intervened and\nreverted the grid positions back to their original locations, meaning pole position would be on the dirty right\nside of the track, where all the bits of tire rubber had been thrown from the tires by the Formula One cars.\nThis meant Senna was off the racing line and it would be more difficult for him to make a better start.\nFrustrated and angry , Senna mimicked Prost's statement of the previous year saying he would not move over\nif Prost attempted to overtake in the first corner . Senna started from pole, with Prost second (albeit on the\nracing line). Prost got ahead of Senna \u2013 but the more powerful Honda engine in Senna's McLaren meant that\nhe was able to make  up a bit of ground . Prost moved over to take the racing line, but Senna dived into the\ncorner to Prost's right to pass him \u2013 and as a result he hit the side of Prost's Ferrari. Both cars went straight\non and both drivers sped through the gravel trap at 160 mph (260 km/h) and crashed into the tyre wall at the\nend of the run-of f area. Senna and Prost were both unhurt, and neither driver bothered to check to see if the\nother was okay . This accident meant that Senna won his second world Drivers' Championship. The crash\nlooked somewhat dubious, and nothing was done to Senna by the FIA; because they had done nothing to\nProst in 1989 for crashing to Senna, they could not do anything to Senna either , with the collision being\ndeclared a \"racing incident\" in the end. Furious and disgusted, Prost later described Senna as \"a man without\nvalue\". Both drivers have been accused of crashing into the other deliberately and thus the two situations as\nwell as their comme nts after both incidents have tainted both drivers' reputation s in the eyes of most but die-\nhard fans.

Prost did not win a race in\nhis uncom petitive Ferrari that year and it turned out to be his last race for the Scuderia that year; he was fired\nfrom the team after the race for describing the 643 as having  handling like \"a truck\". This was the last straw\nfor Ferrari; as Prost had been making unsavory comments about the Italian team for some time. The race\nstarted, and Mansell went off at the first corner on lap 10, and Senna won his 3rd Drivers' Championship in\n4 seasons.  Senna let his teammate Gerha rd Berger through to win as a \"thank you\" gesture for his support all\nseason.

Hill crucially won the\nrace ahead of Schumacher; Suzuka was hammered by a torrential downpour which made conditions very\ndifficult for Hill as Schumacher was an acknowledged specialist in wet-weather conditions. 1995 saw an\nincredible drive from French-Italian Jean Alesi on dry slick tyres in damp conditions. It had rained at the\nstart; but the track was drying. Alesi went into the pits on lap seven, around the time everyone else came in.\nThe French driver began to lap Suzuka in his Ferrari 5 seconds faster than anyone else, and when he came\nout of the pits, he was 17th \u2013 but then over the course of 18 laps climbed to 2nd place, passing car after car\nwhile a number of the other cars changed to slick tyres as well. But then Alesi had to serve a drive-through\npenalty for jumping the start. This did not stop the emotionally highly-strung Alesi: he dropped down to\n10th, but pushed hard; and began passin g car after car. He then went into the pits and dropped to 13th from\n8th as a result. Then he had gone off in the last corner on lap 20 but recovered, and as a result dropped\nfurther down the order to 15th. He then went from 15th to 9th in one lap and got into 2nd again behind\nSchumacher , whom he caught up to and battled with for the lead.

Now starting\nfrom the back of the grid, Schumacher fought hard to catch up, setting\nnumerous fastest laps in his effort to catch his rival.

The tire caused Schumacher's retirement three laps later, leaving H\u00e4kkinen to take victory and his first\ndrivers' championship.\nHakkinen then won his second consecutive drivers' title in 1999, after a fight with Eddie Irvine,\nSchumacher's Ferrari teammate.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3762, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "899c5acd-8470-4f9e-bd17-200129dc7e14": {"__data__": {"id_": "899c5acd-8470-4f9e-bd17-200129dc7e14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7937a306-7a46-4956-9523-0d0ea7969f06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "675f9b07127b8293e4961f7a153d50bae46b19e9ba717be58d9a428dbbc5993b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Satoru Nakajima's Lotus\n100T (2007)The next 5 events were all won by Ferrari; Schumacher won in 2000\u20132002 and 2004, and his teammate\nRubens Barrichello won in 2003. Schumacher won his 3rd title at the 2000 event: he took advantage of his\nsuperior speed in damp conditions during a mid-race rain shower to secure the race win and his first World\nChampionship title for Ferrari. This was Ferrari's first drivers' championship in 21 years. Ferrari completed\ntheir domi nation of the 2002 season by reaching a total points tally of 221 points on the then-used 10-point\nscoring system. At the 2003 event, Schumacher endured one of the most trying  races  in his career , needing\nto come at least eighth, he started at fourteenth on the grid \u2013 but managed to secure the point he needed to\ntake his sixth World Drivers' Championship, beating the record held by Juan Manuel Fangio . Schumacher\nhad an incident-filled race, having a collision with Takuma Sato and another near collision with his brother .\nThe qualif ying sessi on for the 2004 even t, which was due to be held on 9 October , was postponed until race\nday after a typhoon  hit Suzuka. This led to the idea of holding qualifying sessions on a Sunday morning (an\nidea that was abandoned half-way through the following year ).\nThe 2005 race was one of the most exciting races of the season after many top drivers started near the back\nof the grid after the qualifying in variable weather . McLaren driver Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen won the race after\nstarting from 17th place, overtaking Renault driver Giancarlo Fisichella at the beginning of the last lap \u2013\nafter Fisichella was blocked by a backmarker . At the 2006 event , Michael Schumacher led until an engine\nfailure virtually ended his chances of an eighth championship, which went to Spaniard Fernando Alonso .\nIt was announced on 24 March 2006 by the FIA that future races will again be held at the redesigned Fuji\nSpeedway (now owned by Toyota) in Oyama , Sunto District, Shizuoka Prefecture .[10] The news of the\nJapanese Grand Prix moving to the circuit redesigned by Hermann Tilke was met with some trepidation, as\nthe Honda-owned Suzuka was a favorite of many of the drivers and Hermann Tilke's tracks had received\nmixed reviews from the drivers and the fans.\nOn 8 September 2007, it was announced that Fuji will alternate the\nJapanese Grand Prix with Suzuka, starting from 2009 onwards.[11] The\n2007 race was held in torrential rain and started behind the safety car.\nLewis Hamilton took the victory while  his McLaren teammate Fernando\nAlonso crashed heavily. Heikki Kovalainen  finished 2nd, his best result\nuntil that date and Kimi R\u00e4ik k\u00f6nen  3rd, marking the first time that two\nFinnish drivers were together on the podium. In 2008, the first corner\nbrought trouble for both the title conte nding McLarens and Ferraris, and\nFernando Alonso was able to take the victory in a Renault. Felipe Massa was 7th after a penalty for a\ncollision with title rival Lewis Hamilton, while Hamilton finished outside the points, having also served a\npenalty for an incident in the first corner .\nIn July 2009, Toyota cited a global economic slump as the reason that the Japanese Grand Prix would not\nreturn to Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond. The speedway argued, according to the Associated Press , that\n\"continuing to host F1 races could threa ten the survival of the company\". As a result, the 2010 Grand Prix\nwas held at Suzuka, at which point it was announced that Suzuka would have exclusive hosting duties.[12]\nBoth the 2009 and 2010 races were dominated by Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel, with Red Bull finishing 1\u2013\n2 both years.

Kobayashi became the\nfirst Japanese driver to finish on a Formula One podium in Japan in 22\nyears, after Aguri Suzuki in the 1990 Japanese Gran d Prix, and was the\nthird Japan ese drive r to finish on a Formula One podium after Suzuki and\nTakuma Sato  in the 2004 United States Grand Prix .[13]\nThe 2013  race was won by Sebastian  Vettel for Red Bull, marking his\nfourth consecutive victory of the season  as well as his fourth victory overall\nat Suzuka. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber , who started the race on pole\nposition, finished second behind his teammate, with Romain Grosjean\ntaking the final podium position for Lotus.\nIn 2014 , a typhoon  struck the circuit during the race weekend, causing\ncontroversy over the late-afternoon start time not being moved. The race saw both the Mercedes  of Nico\nRosber g and Lewis Hamilton duel with each other for the lead, with Hamilton ultimately taking victory\nahead of his teammate and Sebastian Vettel. However , the race was marred by tragedy . On lap 45, Adrian\nSutil  in the Sauber spun off the track at the Dunlop Curve, and as his car was being recovered by a crane,\nJules Bian chi in the Marussia spun off track at the same area and smashed horrifically into the crane. The\nrace was red flagged  immediately following the accident as conditions were deemed too dangerous to race.\nBianchi was unresponsive to marshals and team radio. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was\nplaced into a coma . It was hoped that he would recover , but Bianchi died nine months later due to his\ninjuries. This led to changes to the circui t for the next year, with drainage gutters  being created at the Dunlop\nCurve to allow water to runof f faster during a rainstorm, as well as the moving of a similar crane to prevent\naccidents such as Bianchi's from occurring in the future.\nOn 23 August 2013 it was announced that the contract for the Japanese Grand Prix had been extended until\n2018.[14] A further extension was announced in August 2018 to keep the race at Suzuka  until 2021. But the\n2020 edition, due to be held on 1 1 October , was cancelled on 12 June due to the COVID-19 pandemic .[15]\nThe 2022 Japanese Grand Prix, held on 9 October 2022, was the first held at Suzuka since 2019 . The race\nsaw a delayed start due to torrential rain, which when the race began would lead to Carlos Sainz Jr. crashing\nhis Ferrari and the race being red-flagged. 28 laps were run. Before the race was suspended, the FIA\ndispatched a recovery vehicle while the race was under double yellow flag conditions, which meant that the\nvehicle was on the track at the same time as the Formula One cars themselv es - leading to a near-miss\nincident for Pierre Gasly, who at that time was driving for Scuderia AlphaT auri and had collided with an\nadvertisement board, meaning that he had to make a quick pit stop and had to catch up to the safety car train,\nnarrowly missing the vehicle. This was sharply criticised by drivers as Gasly's compatriot Jules Bian chi had\nlost his life due to a similar incident in 2014.[16][17][18]\nThis race also saw some confusion regarding the awarding of points; it was widely believed that\nchampionship leader Max Verstappen  would earn half points (19 instead of 25) due to less than 75% of the\nscheduled race distance being completed, which would mean he was one point short of claiming the", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3915, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58abd851-7bf7-4334-9dfe-a35bd4cc638c": {"__data__": {"id_": "58abd851-7bf7-4334-9dfe-a35bd4cc638c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "96051298-0ff1-4561-9a4c-80163e24404e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Japanese_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "2609f626851e12bf627fdb485cc176b538684504ea561c0c40059b8d6aa815b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "championship. How ever, full points were awarded instead and Verstappen became the 2022 Formula One\nWorld Champion; he himself showed surprise when he found out that full points were awarded.[19] This\nconfusion was a result of a rule change implemented for 2022 which was introd uced in response to the rain-\ndisrupted 2021 Belg ian Grand  Prix.[20] For the 2023 seaso n, the points-awarding system was altered to\nutilise the sliding scale system to determine the points being given, regardless if it finishes under red or\ngreen flag conditions.[21]\nOn 5 July 2023 it was announced that the Japanese Grand Prix has been moved from its traditional\nSeptember/October date as it was in previous years, to a slot in April for the 2024 calendar , between the\nAustralian Grand Prix  and the returning Chinese Grand Prix  as part of F1's regionalisation ef forts.[22]\nFrom its return to the Formula One calendar in 1987 , the Japanese Grand  Prix has become one of the most\npopular with spectators. For the 1990 race, three million fans entered a draw for the 120,000 available\ntickets, due to the popularity of Honda 's world championship successes as an engine supplier to the Williams\nand McLaren  teams, the fact that the country had produced its first full-time F1 driver in Satoru Nakajima ,\nand Ayrton Senna's immense popularity in Japan.  After Nakajima's retirement in 1991  and Honda's\nwithdrawal from competition the follow ing year, interest went into decline despite the addition of the Pacific\nGrand Prix to the F1 calendar , an event also held in Japan during the 1994  and 1995  seasons. The 1995\nJapanese Grand Prix was the first for which the allocated tickets did not sell out.[23] Subsequently , the\nappearance of new Japanese drivers such as Takuma Sato and the entry of Honda and Toyota  as full\nmanufacturer teams has restored the event to its former popularity . However , Honda and Toyota left Formula\nOne in 2008 and 2009 respectively , with both teams citing economic reasons. Honda returned to Formula\nOne as an engine supplier for McLaren in 2015, a partnership that lasted until 2018. Honda began supplying\nengines for Toro Ross o (later known first as AlphaT auri and secondly as RB) in 2018, and Red Bull Racing\nin 2019, before leaving Formula One again after the 2021 season. Honda supported the development of Red\nBull Powertrains  engines for the 2022 season and would assist RBPT  engine development for the 2023 to\n2025 seasons before moving to Aston Martin  as a works engine supplier following the 2026 season.[24]\nOfficial attendance numbers have been as follows.[25]Popularity\nAttendance", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2621,
