The new team\nfailed to score a point, achieving a best finish of 7th at the Italian Grand Prix .[9]\nFor the 1978  season, Patrick Head designed\nthe first Williams car: the FW06. Williams\nsigned Alan Jones , who had won the Austrian\nGrand Prix the previ ous season for a devastated Shadow  team\nfollowing the death of their lead driver , Tom Pryce . Jones's first\nrace for the team was the Argentine Grand Prix wher e he qualified\nin 14th position but retired after 36 laps due to a fuel system\nfailure. The team scored its first championship points two races\nlater at the South African Grand Prix when Jones finish ed in\nfourth. Williams earnt their first podium at the United States\nGrand Prix, where Jones came second, 20 seconds behind the Ferrari  of Carlos Reutemann .[10] Williams\nfinished the season in ninth place in the Constructors' Championship, with a respectable 11 points, while\nAlan Jones finished 11th in the Drivers' Championship.

This was the team's first ground effect car, a\ntechnology that was first introduced by Colin Chapman  and Team Lotus. William s also obtained\nmembership of the Formula One Constructors' Association  (FOCA) which expressed a preference for\nteams to run two cars, so Jones was joined at the team by Clay Regazzoni .[11] It was not until the seventh\nround of the championship, the Monaco Grand Prix, that they finished in the points. Regazzoni came\nclose to taking the team's first win but finished second, less than a second behind race winner Jody\nScheckter . The next race, the French Grand Prix, is remembered for the final lap battle between Ren\u00e9\nArnoux  and Gilles Villeneuve , but also saw both cars finish in the points for the first time; as Jones was\nfourth with Regazzo ni in sixth.[12] The team's first win came at the British Grand Prix (their home Grand\nPrix) when Regazzoni finished 25 seconds ahead of second place.\nGreater success followed when Williams got a 1-2 finish at the next round in Germany , Jones in first with\nRegazzoni two seconds behind in secon d. Jones then made it three wins in a row at the Austrian Grand\nPrix, finishing half a minute ahead of Gilles Villeneuve's Ferrari. Three wins in a row became four two\nweeks later at the Dutch Grand Prix, with Alan Jones winning yet again by a comfortable margin over\nJody Sche ckter 's Ferrari. Scheckter  ended Williams's winning streak when he won the Italian Grand Prix;\nwith Regazzoni finishing third behind Scheckter and Villeneuve.

Piquet  left Williams to\njoin Lotus  who had retained their Honda  engines for the 1988 season, helped by having Satoru Nakajima\nas number 2 driver to Piquet. Nelson Piquet called Frank Dernie  every week to persuade him to join\nLotus. Eventually Dernie  moved to Lotus to become their new Technical Director . Williams brought in\nRiccardo Patrese  to replace Piquet. The team did not win a race that season and finished seventh in the\nConstructors' Championship, scoring 20 points. The highlights of the season for the team were two\nsecond-place finishes by Mansell. When Mansell was forced to miss two races due to illness, he was\nreplaced by Martin Brundle  for Belgi um and Jean-Louis Schlesse r for Italy.

Placing first in nine races,\nMansell had set a new record for the most wins by a single driver\nin one year. Despite this, there looked to be significant upheaval at\nWilliams for 1993; what followed led to a domino effect that had\nnot only ef fects on the World Championship, but also the CAR T-sanctioned PPG IndyCar Series .\nWilliams was interested in signing Alain Prost to drive one of its two cars for 1993 as he was returning\nfrom his year long sabbatical after being sacked by Scuderia Ferrari during the 1991 World\nChampionship. Patrese, perhaps figuring that he would be the driver being sacked in order for Prost to\ntake one of the two available rides, decided to leave after driving for Williams since 1987. He would join\nup with Benetton, where he would replace Martin Brundle  alongside Michael Schumacher  in the team's\nCamel -backed Fords.\nMansell, meanwhile, was not pleased that Williams was looking to bring Prost aboard. Prost and Gerhard\nBerger had essentially swapped rides after the 1989 season with Prost becoming Mansell's teammate at\nFerrari. The acrimo nious relationship between the two that ensued nearly resulted in Mansell retiring\nfrom the sport altogether and he had not forgotten this; as such, Mansell began looking for other options\nto continu e his racing career . He eventually decided to move over to CAR T, where he paired with Mario\nAndretti  at Newman/Haas Racing .\nThat seat, meanwhile, had opened up because Andretti's son, Michael , was leaving CAR T to replace\nBerger at McLaren. McLaren also was potentially dealing with losing a driver , as Ayrton Senna's contract\nhad expired following the 1992 season. In addition to this, McLaren's arrangement with Honda to provide\nengines had also expired, and the team had signed to run Ford engines for 1993. With McLaren having\nfallen behind Williams on the grid, combined with his uncertainty regarding the new engine supplier ,\nSenna approached Williams and offered  to take over the second car. His interest was such that he was\nwilling to drive for Williams while collecting no salary .\nHowever , like with Mansell, Prost had a rather testy relationship with Senna from when the two were\nteammates and rivals at McLaren in the 1980s. As such, he negotiated a two-year contract with Williams\nthat gave him the power to approve or disapprove any driver Williams would seek to have him team with\nfor 1993. Once the contract was signed, Prost used that power to freeze Senna out of driving for\nWilliams; he would return to McLaren for one more season with the team running Ford engines.1992 off-season", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3395, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0215c391-7122-4178-aaff-848e47158f5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0215c391-7122-4178-aaff-848e47158f5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Williams_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f3fb353-555d-4de5-b0e4-c9dae28a39d5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Williams_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "3ff17dc7a8d82b74543576e3d5285fa91b1db9989697c41a8a8717ec3eda05e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Williams FW16B used in the second\nhalf of the 1994 season when\nRothmans debuted as the team's\nprimary backerNeeding a replacement, Williams decided not to pursue any of the available drivers such as Berger and\nBrundle.

The veto power in Prost's contract\nwas only in effect for the 1993 season, and since Williams was\nnow free to do as it desired and that Senna was again a free agent, the team decided it would bring in the\nmulti-time former champion.

Senna himself\nhad made numerous  comments that the Williams FW16  had quirks that needed to be ironed out. It was\nobvious that the FW16, after the regulation changes banning active suspens ion and traction control,\nexhibited none of the superiority of the FW15C  and Williams FW14 B cars that had preceded it.

Hill\ntook the team's first victory of the season, by almost half a minute over Schumacher's  Benetton , while\nCoulthard would retire due to an electrical problem. In Montreal , both Williams cars finished in the points\nfor the first time that season, with Hill finishing second and Coulthard finishing fifth. In France, Nigel\nMansell replaced Coulthard (in the first of four appearances), at the behest of Renault.

Hill closed the points gap with Schum acher , who was disqualified\nfrom first at Spa after the Stewards found floorboard irregularities on his Benetton.

As Schumach er recovered, Hill came around the corner and attempted to overtake into the next\ncorner . Schumacher turned in and the resulting contact (Schumacher in the wall and Hill retiring with\nbent suspe nsion), meant Schumacher was the champion. This collision has been controversial. Some,\nsuch as Williams's Patrick Head , have suggested that this was a deliberate attempt by Schumacher to take\nHill out of the race.[24] Others, such as then BBC commentator Murray Walker , defended Schumacher ,\ncalling the accident a \"racing incident\". Meanwhile, Nigel Mansell won the last Grand Prix of his career\nhere, driving the second Williams car .\nWilliams would end the season as Constructors' Champion for the third consecutive year, scoring 118\npoints, while Hill finished second in the Drivers' Championship with 91 points.\nIn 1995 , Nigel Mansell  was not retained, Williams favouring\nCoulthard  over him to partner Hill. Schumacher , whose Benetton\nteam had switched engine suppliers from Ford to Renault in the\noff-season, won the first round in Brazil , with Coulthard taking\nsecond. However , both were disqualified  from the race after it was\nfound that Elf supplied their team s with a type of fuel for which\nsamples had not been provided to the FIA. Thus, Gerhard Berger\nand Ferrari were declared winners. Schumacher and Coulthard had\ntheir positions reinstated after appea l, though Benetton and\nWilliams were not awarded their Constructors' points. Hill won\nthe next two races in Argentina  and San Marino  and woul d later\nwin races at The Hung aroring  and in Adelaide . Hill won two laps\nahead of the field at Adelaide in one of F1's most dominating victories. Coulthard recorded his only 1995\nwin for the Williams team at Estoril , before moving to McLaren.\nWilliams's champion streak was ended by Benetton , who elected to switch engine suppliers  from Ford to\nRenault, the same as Williams. As such, Benetton outscored Williams by 29 points in the Constructors'\nChampionship. Dam on Hill placed second in the Drivers' Championship, 33 points behind Benetton's\nMichael Schumacher .\nFor 1996 , Williams had the quickest and most reliable car, the FW18 .[25] Coulthard had left Williams to\njoin Mika H\u00e4kkinen  at McLare n, and Williams replaced him with Canadian Jacques Villeneuve , who had\nwon the CAR T series title in 1995, while Hill remained with the team. Schumacher  left Benetton  to join\nFerrari . Williams won the first five Grands Prix, Hill winning all but one of them. Olivier Panis  would\ntake victory at the sixth round in Monaco  after both Williams cars retired. Hill would retire for the second\ntime in a row after he spun-of f in Spain , while his teammate, Villeneuve, took third place. Hill and\nVilleneuve dominated the next Grand Prix in Canada , with a 1\u20132 in qualifying and a 1\u20132 finish. Williams\nmade it a second 1\u20132 after Hill won the French Grand Prix.

Villeneuve\nmounted a title challenge going into the final race of the season at\nJapan , but Hill reasserted  his dominance to take the race and the\n1996 title, while Villeneuve lost a wheel and retired.\nWilliams's dominance was such that they had clinched the\nConstructors' Championship and only their drivers had a\nmathematical chanc e of taking the title, several races before the\nseason concluded. Around that time, Frank Williams  announced\nthat Hill would not be re-signed after his contract expired, despite Hill's successes and eventual Drivers'\nChampionship, so he joined Arrows  for 1997. Adrian Newey  had ambitions as a technical director (rather\nthan just chief designer), but this was not possible at Williams, as Patrick Head  was a founder and\nshareholder of the team. McLaren lured Newey away , though he was forced to take garden leave for the\nmajority of 1997.\nFor what would be the final season of Williams-Renault and a car designed with Newey's input, Frank\nWilliams  brought in German Heinz-Harald Frentzen , who had created a good impression on Williams\nduring his first few seasons in Formula One. Frentzen proved to be a disappointment though, and won\nonly one race in two years with Williams, the 1997 San Marino Grand Prix. Jacques Villeneuve  won\nseven races during 1997, compared to five wins by his main rival, Michael Schumacher  of a resur gent\nFerrari. Williams also achieved the 100-race-win milestone at the British Grand Prix. Coming to the final\nround of the season at Jerez , Schumacher led Villeneuve by 1 point; however , on lap 48, Schumacher and\nVilleneuve collided.  Schumacher was disqualified from second place in the championship as the accident\nwas deeme d by the FIA as \"avoidable\". Williams won the Constructors' title for the second time in a row,\nscoring 123 points. Jacques Villeneuv e won the Drivers' Championship by three points to Michael\nSchumacher , who kept his points total despite being removed from second place; thus, runner -up went to\nFrentzen with 42 points.[26]\nAfter 1997 , the team was unable to maintain their dominance in\nFormula 1 as Renault ended their full-time involvement in\nFormula 1, and Adrian Newey  moved to the rival team, McLaren.\nWilliams then had to pay for Mecachrome  engines, which were\nold, rebadged Renault F1 engines.[27] This meant that the FW20\nnot only featured a very similar aerod ynamic package to their\n1997 car but also virtually the same engine, leading some to\ncomment that they ran what was virtua lly the same car, adjusted\nfor the 1998 regulations. There were changes on the sponsorship\nfront, as Rothmans opted to promote their Winfield  brand,\nreplacing the popular blue and white livery with a red one.[28] For1997 season\nMecachrome engines (1998)\n1998 season", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3057, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86a506eb-5556-4e51-b181-e601c659665f": {"__data__": {"id_": "86a506eb-5556-4e51-b181-e601c659665f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Williams_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20709397-a6cd-4911-ba2a-c898ec13a2f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Williams_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "11dda60f0a1de53e019d2f994b42ad4793ac9d9eb4fb1e85517be65ce7096881", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Alessandro Zanardi in the FW21 at\nthe 1999 Canadian Grand Prix\nTeam logo during\npartnership with BMW1998 , Williams  kept both drivers from the previous season, the first time since 1983  that a reigning world\nchampion remained  driving for the team. While Ferrari and McLaren battled for the Constructors' and\nDrivers' titles, Williams fell to the middle of the field. The team won no races and took only 3 podiums\nduring the season, with Frentzen finishing in third at the first round in Australia  and Villeneuve finishing\nthird in Germany  and Hungary . Williams  finished third in the Constru ctors' Championship, scoring 38\npoints, while Villeneuve finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship with 21 points, and his German\nteammate, Frentzen, finished 4 points behind him in seventh.\nIn 1999 , Williams employed the Supertec  engine, which was a\nrebadged Mecachrome-Renault unit, and a new driver line-up.\nVilleneuve  moved to the new British American Racing  (BAR)\nteam, while Frentzen  moved to Jordan  trading places with fellow\nGerman Ralf Schu macher  who joined Williams. To replace\nVilleneuve, Williams signed Italian Alex Zanardi , who after an\nunsuccessful F1 career in the early 1990s had been racing in the\nCAR T series for Chip Ganassi Racing , winning two series\nchampionships and a total of fifteen races in his three years. As\nwith Schumacher , a driver trade was made with Ganassi, where\nZanardi would join Williams and the team's test driver at the time,\nJuan Pablo Montoya , would join CAR T in Zanardi's car for 1999 and 2000.\nThe team managed three podiums, all scored by Ralf Schumacher , with third place in Australia  and\nBritain  and a second place in Italy. Zanardi, meanwhile, struggled through the entire season and failed to\nfinish in the points at any race. Due in large part to this, the team finished fifth in the Constructors'\nChampionship, the lowest finish for Williams in the 1990s; the team finished behind Stewart  and Jordan ,\nwith Schumacher scoring all of the team's 35 points.\nAfter the season, deciding the relationship was not working, Zanardi's contract with the team was\nterminated by mutual agreement. He would eventually return to CAR T in 2001.\nIn 1998, the team signed a long-term agreement with German manufacturer\nBMW  to supply engines and expertise for a period of 6 years. As part of the\ndeal, BMW  expected at least one driver to be German, which led to the\nteam's signing of Ralf Schumacher for the subsequent season. In 1999, the\nteam had a Williams car with a BMW  engine testing at circuits, in\npreparation for a debut in the 2000  season.\nThere were major sponsorship changes for 2000\u20132005, as Rothmans\nInternational had been purchased in 1999 by British American Tobacco  (BAT), which owned British\nAmerican Racing  and chose  not to renew Rothmans's contract with Williams.

A\nhybrid system that uses a spinning composite rotor to store energy, these flywheels help a vehicle save\nfuel and ultimately reduce its CO2 emissions.\nWHP  was first established in 2008 and immediately set about developing a new flywheel energy-recovery\nsystem for the Williams F1 Team after the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) into\nFormula One for the 2009 season. While other teams were pouring their efforts into electric battery\nsystems, Williams F1 opted to go down the flywheel route because of a strong belief in the technology's\nwider applications. While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP  has since\nseen its technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won\nthe 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP  flywheel.
