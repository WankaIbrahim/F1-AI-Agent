Despite this\nimpressive entrance to the Grand Prix scene, over the remainder of\nthe season  the team rarely saw the finish line due to unreliability\nand racing accidents. However , they proved their form was not a\nflash in the pan recording a slow stream of points finishes and\nrarely finishing outside the top ten when they actually completed a\nrace dista nce.

Former Sauber sports car driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen  took up the role as Karl\nWendlinger's teammate.\nEarly signs showed the team was, rather disappointingly , delivering similar\nperformances to the previous year, scoring a small tally of points in the opening\nrounds. The season took a turn for the worse after a fourth place by Wendlinger\nfollowing the tragic deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenber ger at the San\nMarino Grand Prix. Just two weeks later, Wendlinger was seriously injured after\ncrashing in practice for the Monaco Grand Prix; losing control of his car under braking for the Nouvelle\nChicane. He suffered serious head injur ies which left him in a coma for weeks and he was sidelined for\nthe rest of the season. He was replaced by Andrea de Cesaris  and a returning Lehto who had been\nreplaced at Benetton after injury complications.\nThe Wendlinger accident was a pivotal moment in Formula One history . Together with the death of\nAyrton Senna , it later prompted the mandatory implementation of head protection for drivers  in the form\nof high cockpit sides. Sauber voluntarily pioneered prototypes of these to protect their drivers.\nThey would finish the season with the same points tally as the previous year but finished only eighth out\nof the fourteen original entrants.

This was the first Formula One victory for a\nBMW  engine since the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix .\nAfter the team's breakthrough win, development was switched to the 2009 season where new regulations\ncome into play. This greatly annoyed Kubica, (who was leading the champio nship after the Canadian\nGrand Prix), as he felt they could have had a realistic chance of taking at least one title. The lack of\ndevelopment was reflected with a drop of form throughout the second half of the season, causing BMW\nto be outpaced by Renault, Toyota and even Toro Rosso (who started the season as one of the slowest\nteams) by the end of the season.

After the qualifying session for the British Grand Prix Mario\nTheissen announced that the team had decided to halt further development of KERS; of which BMW  had\nbeen one of the strongest proponents, and focus instead on improving the car's aerodynamics.
