Since 1996 , it has been\nheld at the Albert Park Circuit  in Melbourne ,\nwith the exceptions of 2020  and 2021, when the\nraces were cancelled due to the COVID-19\npandemic .[2] Before that, it was held in\nAdelaide .[3]\nWhile an event called the Australian Grand Prix\nwas stage d in 1927 at the grass surface\nGoulburn Racecou rse held as a serie s of\nsprints,[4] it is generally accepted that the\nAustralian Grand Prix began as the 100 Miles\nRoad Race  held at the Phillip Island road circuit\nin 1928.[5] The inaugural race was won by\nArthur Waite in what was effectively an entry\nsupported by the Austin Motor Company , a\nmodified Austin 7. For eight years, races, first\ncalled the Australian Grand Prix in 1929 ,\ncontinued on the rectangular dirt road circuit.\nBugattis  dominated the results, taking four\nconsecutive wins from 1929 to 1932. The last Phillip Island race was in 1935 and the title lapsed for three\nyears. An AGP  style event was held on Boxing Day, 1936  at the South Austra lian town of Victor Harbor\nfor a centennial South Australian Grand Prix[6] before the Australian Grand Prix title was revived in 1938\nfor the grand opening of what would become one of the world's most famous race tracks, Mount\nPanorama  just outside the semi-rural town of Bathurst .

Mount Panorama  held the first post-\nwar Grand Prix in 1947 , beginning a rotational system between the Australian States,[8] as fostered by the\nAustralian Automobile Association .[9] A mixture  of stripped-down production  sports cars and Australian\n\"specials\" were to take victories as the race travelled amongst temporary conv erted airfield circuits and\nstreet circuits like Point Cook, Leyburn , Nuriootpa  and Narrogin  before, on the races return to Mount\nPanorama in 1952 , the way to the future was pointed by Doug Whiteford  racing a newly imported Talbot-\nLago  Formula One car to victory . Grand Prix machinery had already been filtering through in the shape\nof older Maserati  and OSCAs  and smal ler Coopers  but had yet to prove to be superior to the locally\ndeveloped cars. The end of the Australian \"specials\" was coming, but the magnificent Maybach -based\nseries of specials driven exuberantly by Stan Jones  would give many hope for the next few years.\nLex Davison , who for several years would experiment with sports car engines in smalle r Formula 2\nchassis, took his first of four victories in a Jaguar  engined Formula 2 HWM  in 1954 , while the previous\nyear Whiteford won his third and final Grand Prix as for the first time racing cars thundered around the\nstreets surrounding the Albert Park Lake  in inner Melbourne . That circuit, which for four brief years gave\nAustralia the stronge st taste of the grandeur surrounding European Grand Prix racing, was 40 years later\nvery much modified, used to host the 1996 Australian Grand Prix as the modern Formula One world\nchampionship venue . Jack Brabham  took his first of three AGP  wins in 1955  at the short Port Wakefield\nCircuit  in South Australia . The race is significant in that Brabham was driving a Bristol  powered Cooper\nT40, the first ever rear -engine car to win the Grand Prix.\nThe Grand Prix returned to Albert Park in 1956 , the year when Melbourne hosted the Summer Olympics ,\nto play host to a group of visiting Europ ean teams, led by Stirling Moss and the factory Maserati  racing\nteam who brought a fleet of 250F  Grand Prix cars and 300S  sports racing cars. Moss won the Grand Prix\nfrom Maserati teammate Jean Behra . That 1956 race would inspire the next great era of the Grand\nPrix.[10]\nThe growing influence of engineer -drivers Jack Brabham  and a couple of years behind him New\nZealander Bruce McL aren woul d transform the race. Brabham, who first won the Grand Prix in 1955  in a\nCooper T40 Bristol he had brought home from his first foray into English racing,[11] would test new\ndevelopments for Cooper during the European winter , beginning a flood of Cooper -Climax Grand Prix\nmachinery into Australia and New Zealand before Brabham started building his own cars, as well as the\nappearance of Lotus chassis as well, finally killing off the Australian \"specials\".

During this era, the former\nTasman stars, Matic h, Geoghegan and Bartlett would continue on as a new gene ration of drivers emer ged,\nsome like Garrie Cooper  (Elfin ) and Graham McRae  developing their own cars while others like Max\nStewart , John McC ormack  and Alfredo Costanzo  using European-built cars, mostly Lolas .

Jones, who started  19th, stalled at the start but fought his way to sixth by lap 20\nbefore retiring later in the lap with electr ical failure. The 1986 event was a three-way race for the Drivers'\nChampionship.

Whilst\ncomfortably in the top three with 20 laps to go, Mansell's Williams suffered a spectacular mechanical\nfailure, with a rear tyre puncture at 180 mph (290 km/h) on the Brabham Straight, creating a huge shower\nof sparks as the floor of the vehicle dragged along the bitumen surface. Mansell fought to control the\nviolently veering car and steered it to a safe stop. Prost took the lead, as Mansell's teammate Piquet had\npitted as a pre-cautionary measure, and the Frenchman won the race and the championship. Prost had to\nfight back after a mid-race puncture, and stopped soon after the finish so as not to waste fuel, something\nhe had done at every race he finished since his disqualification from the 1985 San Marino Grand Prix for\nbeing underweight after his McLaren ran out of fuel on his slow down lap after crossing the line first.\n1987 saw Gerhard Berger win in his Ferrari while Ayrton Senna finished second but was then disqualified\nfor technical irregularities in his last race for Lotus; Berger's teammate Michele Alboreto was then moved\nup to second place to make the final result a Ferrari 1\u20132.\n1988 , the last Grand Prix of the turbo era, saw Alain Prost win his seventh race of the season from\nMcLaren teammate and newly crowned World Champion Ayrton Senna with outgoing champion Nelson\nPiquet third for Lotus, giving Honda turbo's all three podium positions. The race was also the 15th win\nand 15th pole in 16 races in a season of total dominance for McLaren-Hond a, a domination not seen\nbefore or since in Formula One. 1989 was hit by a deluge of rain and the drive rs, notably Prost, did not\nwant to start the race because of the very wet conditions, particularly on the Brabham straight. This event\ncame after controversial events 2 weeks before at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, where Prost had\ncrashed into his hated teammate Senna, and Senna got going again and finished  1st on the road but after\npolitical discussions was disqualified for cutting the chicane before the pit straight at Suzuka; the\nrepercussions of which dawned on the race. McLaren had decided to appeal Senna's disqualification; so\nSenna still had a chance of winning the championship.

Senna had crashed into Prost at the very first corner on the first lap of the race; and he\nwon the Drivers' Championship for the second time. The Australian Grand Prix that year was an\nincredibly exciting race: Senna led for 61 laps, but crashed near the entrance to the permanent race course\nbecause of gearbox problems. The race then turned into a dead-heat sprint between Nelson Piquet in his\nBenetton -Ford  and Nigel Mansell in his Ferrari. Mans ell charged through the field and repeatedly broke\nthe lap record in pursuit of his former Williams teammate. This almost ended in disaster when the Ferrari\nalmost hit the Benet ton at the end of the Brabham Straight in a last-ditch overtaking move on the last lap.\nPiquet won from the Ferraris of Mansell and Prost. There was pre-race controversy when Prost refused to\ntake part in both the annual end of season drivers' photo and the special photo shoot with the World\nChampions in attendance (including legendary five-time champion Juan Manuel Fangio , three-time\nchampions Sir Jack Brabham , Jackie Stewart , Niki Lauda, and Nelson Piquet; and other world champions\nJames Hunt, Alan Jones, Denny Hulme and Senna ), as Prost was still disgusted  and angry did not wish to\nappear in the photos with Senna following their controversial first corner crash in the previous race in\nJapan  which gave the 1990  World Championship to Senna.\nThe 1991 race was notable for being held in extremely wet and tricky conditions and the race was\neventually stopped after 14 of the scheduled 82 laps and Ayrton Senna  was decla red the winner . Prost had\nbeen fired from Ferrari for making unsavory comments about the car after Suzuka; he did not compete in\nthis race. The Drivers' Championship had already been decided in Senna's favour; but the Constructors'\nChampionship was still yet to be decided between McLaren and Williams. Senna's victory plus his\nteammate Gerhard Berger's third gave McLaren its fourth consecutive Constructors' Championship;\nWilliams (which was behind McLaren in points) drivers Mansell finished second (but crashed near the\nrace's end at the chicane after the pits) and Riccardo Patrese finished fifth. This race held the record of\nbeing the shortest ever Formula One race as it only lasted 52 kilometres (33 miles)/24 minutes. It would\neventually be surpassed by the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, which lasted three laps, but was classified after\nonly one official lap. Triple World Cham pion Nelson Piquet, who finished fifth, retired from Grand Prix\nracing following the race.\n1992 saw Senna drive very hard to try to stay with new world champion Mansell's dominant Williams;\nthis ended  in Senna running into the back of Mansell at the last corner . Mansell retired from Formula One\nand went to compete  in CAR T in the United States; Senna's teammate Gerhard Berger won the race. 1993\nsaw Senna win what was to be his 41st and final victory and final race for McLaren ahead of Alain Prost,\nwho was competing  in his final Formula One race in a Williams before he too retired. Senna embraced\nhis once extremely bitter rival Prost on the podium. It was announced around this time that the Australian\nGrand Prix would be moving to Melbourne for 1996.\nThe 1994  was to see yet another memorable weekend. Following his win at the Japanese Grand Prix,\nDamon Hill was now one point behind championship leader Michael Schumacher . Nigel Mansell ,\nreturning to Formula One in place of the late Senna, was on pole but a poor start resulted in the two\nchampionship rivals Hill and Schumacher battling for the lead.

He was critically injured in the crash and was saved only due to an emer gency\ncricothyroidotomy  that was performed by the side of the track by Sid Watkins .[18] This incident forged a\nstrong bond between H\u00e4kkinen and team principal Ron Dennis , and also sent forth a new movement for\nextra safety in the sport. Luckily , H\u00e4kkinen recovered fully and was fit to race again in 1996, thus\nmissing only one race. H\u00e4kkinen climbed back into a Formula One car at Paul Ricard three months after\nthe accident.[19] The final F1 race at Adelaide was won by Damon Hill in a Williams, with almost all of\nhis main rivals including Schumacher retiring, and Hill finished two laps ahead of second-placed Olivier\nPanis.\nIn 1993 prominent Melbourne busines sman Ron Walker began\nworking with the Kennett government to make Melbourne the host\nof the event. After  the government of Jeff Kenn ett spent an\nundisclosed amount,[20] it was announced on 17 December 1993\n(less than a week after the South Australian election ) that the race\nwould be shifted to a rebuilt Albert Park Circuit  in Melbourne .[21]\nThe race moved to Melbourne in 1996. The decision to hold the\nrace there was controversial. A series of protests were organised\nby the \"Save Alber t Park\" group, which claimed that the race\nturned a public park into a private playground for one week per\nyear. Additionally , they claimed that the race cost a great deal of money that would be better spent, if it\nwere to be spent on motor racing, on a permanent circuit elsewhere. Finally , they said that the claimed\neconomic benefits of the race were false or exaggerated. The race organisers and the government claimed\nthat the economic benefits to the state,  although unquantifiable, outweighed the costs, and highlighted\nthat the park's public amenities have been greatly improved from the World War II vintage facilities\npreviously located at Albert Park; the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre (scene of many Melbourne\n2006 Commonwealt h Games  events) being the centre piece and best known of the revitalised facilities.\nOpponents of holding the race in the park point out that the Aquatic Centre adds nothing to the Grand\nPrix, is effectively closed for weeks surrounding the event and could have been built independent of the\ncar race.\nBernie Ecclestone , the then president of Formula One\nManagement , the group that runs modern-day Formula One in\nconjunction with the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile\n(FIA), once famously said that it took 10 minutes to do the deal\nwith Melbourne that would see the Victorian capital host the\nAustralian Grand Prix from 1996.

A 16-turn circuit, which measures 5.3 km\n(3.3 mi) in its current guise, it was built utilising a\ncombination of public roads and a car park within the park.\nThe circuit is renow ned as being a smooth and high-speed test\nfor Formula One teams and drivers. Its characteristics are similar to the only other street circuit set in a\npublic park used in the Formula One World Championship, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve  in Montreal\nwhich hosts the Canadian Grand Prix. The promotional theme for the first race in Melbourne was\n\"Melbourne \u2013 What a Great Place for the Race\". Some 401,000 people turned out for the four days\nleading up to and including the first race in 1996, which remains a record for the event. The logistics of\ncreating a temporary circuit and hosting an event of the magnitude of a Formula One Grand Prix from\nscratch were not lost on the internat ional visitors, with Melbourne winning the F1 Constructors'\nAssociation Award for the best or ganised Grand Prix of the year in its first two years (1996 and 1997).\nIt took just three corners for the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park to gain worldwide attention. On the\nfirst lap of the first race in 1996, Jordan's Martin Brundle  was launched into the air in an enormous\naccident. Footage of the crash, and Brundle's subsequent rush back to the pits to take the spare car for the\nrestart, ensured the first race in Melbourne gained widespread coverage. The race was won by Williams's\nDamon Hill .\nThe 1997 race saw McLaren , through David Coulthard , break\na drought of 50 races without a victory . The next year was a\nMcLaren benefit, with Mika H\u00e4kkinen  and Coulthard lapping\nthe entire field en route to a dominant 1\u20132 finish. The result\nwas clouded by controversy when Coulthard pulled over with\ntwo laps remaining  to allow H\u00e4kkinen to win, honouring a\npre-race agreement between the pair that whoever made it to\nthe first corner in the lead on lap one would be allowed to\nwin. Ferrari won its first Grand Prix in Melbourne in 1999,\nbut it was not with team number one Michael Schumacher .\nNorthern Irishman Eddie Irvine  took his maiden victory after\nthe all-conquering McLarens of H\u00e4kkinen and Coulthard\nretired before half-distance. Schumacher broke his Melbourne drought the following year when he\nheaded a dominant Ferrari 1\u20132 with new teammate Rubens Barrichello . The 2001 event, also won by\nMichael Schumacher , was marked by tragedy when 52-year -old volunteer marshal Graham Beveridge\nwas killed after a high-speed accident involving Ralf Schumacher and Jacque s Villeneuve on lap five.\nVilleneuve's B.A.R. rode up across the back of Schumacher's Williams and crashed into the fence, behind\nwhich Beveridge was standing; Beveridge was hit by a tyre that flew of f of Villeneuve's car .", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3343, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "766991fa-7976-44c2-b99b-71c8f07596ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "766991fa-7976-44c2-b99b-71c8f07596ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "15156ffe-9c72-4d2c-94f2-1a7a6f19f471", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "b9007db498170912ac597021d7570f59bbecbbbea958ab301304cfd41594d21a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The start of the 2002 race saw pole-sitter Barrichello and Williams's Ralf Schumacher  come together at\nTurn One in a spectacular accident that saw 11 of the 22 cars eliminated before the end of the opening\nlap.

Webber , in an underpowered and underfunded Minardi , had to recover from a botched late pit stop\nand resist the challen ges of Toyota's Mika Salo in the closing stages , and took to the podium after the race\nwith Australian team owner Paul Stoddart in one of Melbourne's more memorable Grand Prix moments.\nThe next year, 2003 , saw Coulthard again win for McLaren in a race held in variable conditions.

The team\nwas formed from the remnants of Honda Racing F1 who had withdrawn from the sport following the\n2008 season. The race ended with Butto n, who had led from the start, leading the field over the line after\nthe safety car had been deployed with three laps remaining following a crash between Sebastian Vettel\nand Robert Kubica , who had been fighting for second place. This promoted Button's teammate, fellow\nBrawn GP driver Rubens Barrichello, to second, marking a historic 1-2 for the team. Toyota's  Jarno Trulli\nwas given a 25-second penalty for passing Lewis Hamilton for third place under yellow flags during that\nsafety car period, which promoted Hamilton into that position. However , Hamilton was later disqualified\nand docke d his points for \"deliberatel y misleading stewards\",[22] with Trulli reinstated in third. The\nresults earned by Brawn , Williams , and Toyota  were awarded, despite an appeal being  held two weeks\nlater again st a ruling on the legality of the teams' diffuser design.[23] The outco me of the appeal was in\nfavour of the teams, their diffusers were  declared legal under the new rules and there were no changes to\nthe results of the race.\n2010  again saw Button win at Melbourne.

proponents of the event claim that\nthe event increases tourism, creates jobs and generates millions of dollars for the state of Victoria, while\nopponents dispute the event's economic  benefits and cite the cost on taxpayers to host the event, as well\nas the disruptions generated by the event.[51] In 2014, the Victorian government claimed the annual\neconomic impact of hosting the Australian Grand Prix was between $32 million and $39 million, with the\nevent generating significant economic , social and cultural benefits including job creation, industry\ndevelopment, inwar d investment and tourism, while opponents of the event claimed that the event cost\nVictorian taxpayers over $50 million to host.[52]\nAccording to a 2022 economic impact  assessment conducted by Ernst & Young , the 2022 Aust ralian\nGrand Prix generated  an estimated $92 million of direct spending in the Victorian econom y and boosted\nVictoria's Gross State Product by an estimated $171 million, with the Grand Prix also credited for driving\nup hotel occupancy  and stimulating patronage for hospitality businesses.[53] This mirrors a 2011 EY\nreport commissioned by Tourism Victoria, which found international exposure and tourism spendingCalendar  change\nEconomic impact", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3446, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "299a19d9-0484-43a8-979b-ee752adf0e75": {"__data__": {"id_": "299a19d9-0484-43a8-979b-ee752adf0e75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef20b17e-4d14-46b3-894f-ee2934fb70b4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Australian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "711e7af0cf304f1790c7465e23da2fe3221b5c76e0859b0cd59be21dcb47a3d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Celebrity Challenge, 2008 GPstemming from hosting the Grand Prix generated between $32.04 million and $39.34 million for\nVictoria's Gross State Product during the period in which the Grand Prix was held, while also generating\nbetween 351 and 411 full-time equivalent jobs.[54][55] Accordin g to an Economic Impact Assessment\nconducted by EY, the 2023 Australian Grand Prix contributed an estimated $268 million to the Victorian\neconomy , including  $144 million in direct expenditure and the creation of 1,149 full-time equivalent\njobs,[56] with $128 million of direct investment contributed by 81,000 international and interstate visitors\nwho attended the event.[57]\nHowever , a cost-benefit analysis of the Australian Grand Prix done for the Auditor -General in 2005\nrevealed a net econo mic loss for Victori a, with the estimated costs of the event  exceeding the benefits to\nVictorian taxpayers by 5 per cent,[58] a 2007 auditor -general's report found costs to host the event\nexceeded benefits by $6.7 million,[59][60] while a 2012 repor t commissioned by Economists at Large for\nSave Albert Park estimated that the 2012 Grand Prix resulted in a net economic loss to Victoria of\nbetween $48.8m and $66.7m, with a mid-range estimate of $60.55m.[61] The 2007 Australian Grand Prix\nran at a $34.6 million loss,[62] while according to Crikey , the Australian Grand Prix made losses of\n$59.97 million in 2014, $61.7 million in 2015, $61 million in 2016 and $57.1 million in 2017.[63]\nOver the decade preceding 2022, the Australian Grand Prix collectively cost Victorian taxpayers $537.5\nmillion to host, with the 2019 Australian Grand Prix alone costing Victorian taxpayers $60.2 million to\nhost, the 2022 Aust ralian Grand Prix alone costing Victorian taxpayers $78.1  million to host, and the\n2023 Gran d Prix alone costing Victoria n taxpayers $100.6 million to host.[64] The 2019 event generated\n$55 million in revenue but cost $115.2 million to stage, the 2022 event generated $75.1 million in\nrevenue but cost $153.2 million to stage,[65] and the 2023 event generated $96.9 million in revenue but\ncost $197.6 million to stage.[66]\nFollowing the move of the Australian Grand Prix to\nMelbourne, spectator attendance peaked  at 452,055 in 2024,\nbut has never reached that of the last Adelaide race in 1995.\nIn 2009, the global financial crisis , higher unemployment and\na snap public transport strike[67] were cited by Victorian\nPremier John Brumby  as a reason for a slight drop in\ncrowds.[68] Attendance numbers improved in 2010 to an\nestimate of 305,000 \u2013 the lar gest since the 2005 race.\nIn contrast to other major sporting events in Australia such as\nthe AFL Grand Final , the Melbourne Cup, the Australian\nOpen  and the Boxing Day Test, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation  does not release precise crowd\nfigures for the Australian Grand Prix, citing security concerns;
