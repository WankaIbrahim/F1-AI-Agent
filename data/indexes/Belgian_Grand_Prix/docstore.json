The first national race of Belgium\nwas held in 1925 at the Spa region's race cours e,\nan area of the country that had been associated\nwith motor sport since the very early years of\nracing. To accommodate Grand Prix motor racing ,\nthe Circuit de Spa-Franc orchamps  race course was\nbuilt in 1921 but until 1924 it was used only for\nmotorcycle racing. After the 1923 success of the\nnew 24 hours of Le Mans in France, the Spa 24\nHours , a similar 24-hour endurance race, was run\nat the Spa track.\nSince its inception, Spa-Francorchamps has been\nknown for its unpre dictable weather . At one stage\nin its history it had rained at the Belgian Grand\nPrix for twenty years in a row. Frequently drivers\nconfront a part of the course that is clear and\nbright while another stretch is rainy and slippery .\nThe Belg ian Gran d Prix was desig nated the\nEuropean Grand Prix six times between 1925 and\n1973, when this title was an honorary designation\ngiven each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe.\nIt is one of the most popular races on the Formula\nOne calendar , due to the scenic and historical Spa-\nFrancorchamps circu it being a favourite  of drivers\nand fans.\nIn 1925, the first Belgian Grand Prix was held at the very fast, 9-mile Spa-Francorchamps circuit located in\nthe Ardennes region of eastern Belgium , about half an hour from Liege. This race was won by the Italian\nworks Alfa driver Antonio Ascari , whose son Alberto  would win the race in 1952 and 1953. After winning\nthe Belgian race, Antonio Ascari was killed in his next race at the 1925 French Grand Prix. The Grand Prix\ndid not come back until 1930, and the circuit had been modified, bypassing the Malmedy chicane.

The\n1939 race saw the birth of the Raidillon corner; it was a bypass of the\nAncienne Douane section. In contrast to popular belief, only the\nsmall kink to the left at the bottom of the drop is named Eau Rouge,\nwhich directly leads into Raidillon, a very long right uphill corner;[5]\nand the tricky left blind corner at the top has no name. The conditions\nwere dreadful, and the race was marred by the death of British driver\nRichard \"Dick\" Seaman  while leading the race. Going into Club house corner , Seaman was pushing hard; he\nskidded off the rain-soaked road, hit a tree and his Mercedes caught fire. Seaman received life-threatening\nburns, and he succum bed to his injuries later in hospital. The race was won by Seaman's teammate Hermann\nLang . World War II broke out, and the Belgian Grand Prix did not return until June 1946, when the 2 to 4.5\nlitres race at the Bois de la Cambre  public park in the Belgian capital of Brussels  was won by Frenchman\nEug\u00e8ne Chaboud  in a Delage.\nSpa was modified to make it even faster , shortening it to 8.7 miles (14.1 km). All of the slow corners were\ntaken out \u2013 the Stavelot hairpin was bypassed and made into a fast banked corner and the Malmedy chicane\nwas also bypassed. At this time, every corner except La Source was ultra-hig h speed. Spa over this time\nbecame known as one of the most extreme, challenging and fearsome circuits in motorsports history . 1950\nsaw the introduction of the Formula One World Championship; the race was dominated by the Alfa Romeos\nof Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio  and Italia n Nino Farina . Their closest challe nger, Alberto Ascari , ran into\nfuel proble ms and fell back. The race was won by Fangio, and Farina won the next year's race in his works\nAlfa after Fangio dropped back with hub problems. 1953 saw Ascari dominate in his Ferrari while the\nMaseratis fell apart. Fangio crashed and Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez  had a steering failure and stopped out near\nthe banked  Stavelot corner . 1955 saw Mercedes dominate, Fangio and his British teammate Stirling Moss led\nthe race distance. Moss followed Fangio closely for most of the race, the Argentine took victory as he had\nthe year before in a Maserati. 1956 saw a wet race, with Moss in a Maserati lead, and Fangio, now driving\nfor Ferrari, made a bad start and dropped to fifth at the start, although he got up to second behind Moss. The\ntrack was drying, and Moss lost a wheel at Raidillon corner . He did not hit anything and went back to take\nover his teammate Cesare Perdisa's car and was able to finish 3rd. The gearbox in Fangio's car broke, and his\nteammate Peter Collins won the race.\nThe 1957 race was cancelled because there was no money for the race to be held, thanks to the extreme\nprices of fuel in Belgium and the Netherlands caused by the Suez crisis . 1958 saw Spa upgraded with new\nfacilities, a resurfaced track and also the pit straight was made wider . But Spa had gained a reputation as a\ntotally unfor giving, frightening and a very mentally challenging circuit, even in those safety-absent days, and\nmost racing events there \u2013 particularly the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa \u2013 had smaller -than-average fields\nbecause a number of drivers feared the circuit and did not like racing there.

Spa was located in a region where the weather was unpredictable; in many races there, while one part of\nthe track was dry and had sunshine, another at the same time was soaking wet and it was raining there. There\nwere no radios in the days of the old Spa circuit, so drivers had no idea of circuit conditions and could\nencounter rain without warning, where there had been none on the previous lap. The nature of the circuit\nmeant that cars spinning off could hit telegraph poles, houses, stone walls, embankments or trees. Many\ndrivers were killed or seriously injured at Spa during the 1950s in all disciplines  of motorsport that competed\nthere.\n1958 was won by Briton Tony Brooks, driving a Vanwall, from his teammate Stirling Moss. The race was\nnot run in 1959, but 1960 was to be one of the darkest weekends in the history of Formula One. Grand Prix\nracing had moved forward to a new kind of car design \u2013 new British independe nt teams such as Cooper and\nLotus had pioneered the rear-mid-engined car, much like the Auto Union Grand Prix cars of the 1930s.\nThese cars were considerably lighter , faster and easier to drive than their front-engined predecessors, and it\nbecame obvious that rear-mid-engined cars were the way to go in purpose-buil t automobile racing. But this\nnew type of cars had not been driven at Spa before, so no one knew how they would perform there. The\nhigh-speed bends at Spa were now much faster with these new cars \u2013 and in those days, the cars or circuits\nfor that matter had absolutely no safety features of any kind. The cylinder -shaped bodywork was made of\nvery thin highly flammable magnesium  or fibreglass, and the tube-frame chassis of that day offered little\ncrash resistance (as opposed to a modern-day monocoque, pioneered by Lotus only a few years later). Cars\nwere not crash-teste d and lacked roll bars (made mandatory in 1961) and fire extinguishers. Although drivers\ndid wear helmets, they were made of weak and lightweight material and not scientifically designed or tested.\nDrivers in those days did not wear seatbelts \u2013 they found it preferable to be thrown from a car that might be\non fire to reduce the chance of injury or death.\nDuring practice, Stirling Moss, now driving a privately entered Lotus, had a wheel come off his car and he\ncrashed heavily at the Burnenville right-hander . Moss, who was considered one of the best racing drivers in\nthe world at the time, was thrown out of his car and landed unconscious in the middle of the track. The\nEnglishman broke both legs, three vertebrae, several ribs and had many cuts and abrasions; he survived but\ndid not race for most of that year. Briton Mike Taylor , also driving a Lotus, suffered a steering failure and\ncrashed into trees next to the track near Stavelot. Taylor then was trapped in the car for some time with\nserious head and neck injuries. The accident ended his racing career; he later successfully sued Lotus\nfounder Colin Chap man in British court for sale of faulty machinery . The race itself, however , was to be\neven more  disastrou s. On lap 17, Briton Chris Bristow, driving a Cooper , was fighting for sixth  with Belgian\nWilly Mairesse . Bristow had never driven at Spa before , and was regarded as a brash and daring driver who\nhad a reputation for being rather wild;  the relatively inexperienced 22-year -old Englishman had been in\nmany accidents during his short career . Mairesse was also known as an aggress ive driver who had a win-at-\nall-costs mentality and was known to be difficult to pass, particularly on his home track. Bristow and\nMairesse touched wheels, and the Englishman lost control at Malmedy , overturned and crashed into an\nembankment on the right side of the track. The car rolled several times, Bristow was thrown from his car and\nwas decapitated by some barbed-wire fencing next to the circuit, killing him instantly; his body partially\nlanded on the track where it stayed for some time. Mairesse continued, but retired from the race later on with\ngearbox trouble. 5 laps later, 26-year -old Briton Alan Stacey , running in sixth place and driving a works\nLotus, suffered a freak accident when he was hit in the face by a bird on the Masta straight not far from\nwhere Bristow had been killed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4254, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5698b096-53db-4f12-b4a3-02591059b3b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "5698b096-53db-4f12-b4a3-02591059b3b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5529483c-c89f-4519-9f9b-f9d1a0f5b7e9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "b5fc9df4a265ffff1f78ab2c62198800ffeef78e32d8029296b34e66cc8d1b1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "afc8b20a-ec91-40a2-ba1d-75d5ad207312", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "e79f41b817875f9d9a4f323928bbde35e989a5c7d14a5945ef9f6aad437580e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Bristow and\nMairesse touched wheels, and the Englishman lost control at Malmedy , overturned and crashed into an\nembankment on the right side of the track.

This year saw another rain-soaked race: on the first lap, as the\nfield reached the far side of the circuit, a heavy rainstorm caused seven drivers to hydroplane off at\nBurnenville. Briton Jackie Stewart  had a high speed accident at the Masta Kink, where he went through a\nwoodcutter's hut, hit a telegraph pole, and dropped into a much lower part of the circuit where the car landed\nupside down. The BRM Stewart was driving had bent itself over his legs, so he could not get out by himself\nand the Scot ended up being stuck in his car for nearly 30 minutes. The fuel tanks, which were bags located\ninside the car that flanked the driver , had ruptured and were soaking him with flammable fuel, and he also\nhad broke n ribs and collarbone. Stewart's BRM teammate Graham Hill and Bob Bond urant , both of whom\nhad gone of f near Stewart, came to help. Because of the absence of safety precautions in those days, they had\nto borrow spanners from a nearby spectator , and the two drivers got Stewart out. There were other bad\naccidents on the circuit; some of the cars were hanging off 30-feet-high ledges.  Stewart's crash at this race\ninspired his subsequent crusade for safety at racetracks. There was so much water on the track that the\nClimax engine in Clark's Lotus was flooded and failed. Briton John Surtees  won the race in a Ferrari,\nfollowed by Austrian Jochen Rindt  in a Cooper .\n1967 saw American Dan Gurney in his Eagle win after Clark had mechanical problems \u2013 it was to be Eagle's\nonly F1 victory . Briton Mike Parkes  crashed heavily at 150 mph at Blanchimont after slipping on some oil\nthat had dropped off of Jackie Stewart's BRM. After his car hit and climbed up an embankment, the works\nFerrari driver was thrown out of his car, receiving serious leg and head injuries. He was in a coma for a\nweek, and initially his legs were in danger of needing amputation. He survived , but never raced in Formula\nOne again. 1968 saw a number of firsts: wings as an aerodynamic device were  introduced for the first time\nin Formula One. The European constructors, particularly Colin Chapman  and Mauro Forghieri , were\ninfluenced by American Jim Hall's Chaparral  2E and 2F sports cars' very large high strutted wings. New\nZealander Chris Amon  qualified his rear-wing equipped Ferrar i on pole position by 4 seconds over Stewart\nin a Matra. Come race day, McLaren won their first ever victory as a constructor , with its founder Bruce\nMcLaren winning \u2013 but the race saw yet another serious accident.

But Spa was still too fast and too dangerous, and in 1971 the Belgian Grand Prix\nwas cancelled, as the track was not up to mandatory FIA-mandated safety specs that year. The event was\nthen eventually relocated.\nFollowing that decision, the Belgians decided to alternate their Grand Prix between Zolder  in northern\nBelgium and a circuit at Nivelles-Baulers  near Brussels . The first race at Nivelles in 1972 was won by\nEmerson Fittipaldi . Zolder hosted the race the following year and it was won by Jackie Stewart . Formula\nOne returned to Nivelles in 1974. Once again the race was won by Fittipaldi, but the circuit was unpopular\namong the Formula One circus and after that event the organizers were unable to sustain a Grand Prix at\nNivelles, and the track faded from the racing scene.\nThe Belgian Grand Prix would be held at Zolder a further nine times. Niki Lauda  scored back-to-back\nvictories at the track  in 1975 and 1976, and in 1977 Gunnar Nilsson  scored his only F1 victory at Zolder .\nThe following year Mario Andretti dominated the race for Lotus , driving the 79 in its debut race.

Next , the other Arrows driver , Italian Siegfried Stohr, hit the back of Patrese's car, where Luckett was\nstanding. Luckett was knocked unconsc ious and laid sprawled on the circuit. Then, when the field reached\nthe pit straight again (by which time Luckett had been removed from the road, although the track still had\nStohr's broken Arrow s car on the circuit and the surface was littered with debris) a number of track marshals\njumped onto the tarmac and frantically waved their arms to try to make the field stop while waving yellow\nflags instead of red flags. The cars went by at full racing speeds. When they came back again for the third\nlap they voluntarily stopped themselves. The race was restarted and was won by Reutemann.

Coulthard later admitted he had been at fault, due to his own inexperience.[9] Only eight drivers\nwere class ified finishers (two of whom were five laps behind, one of whom was Coulthard) and Damon Hill\nsecured a victory ahead of his teammate Ralf Schumacher  to record the Jordan  team's first Formula One win.\nSchumacher won his 52nd Grand Prix at Spa in 2001, surpassing Alain Prost 's all-time record of 51 wins.\nSchumacher also won his seventh World Drivers' Championship title at Spa in 2004. There was no Belgian\nGrand Prix in 2003 because of the country's tobacco advertising laws. In 2006, the FIA announced the\nBelgian Grand Prix would not be on the calendar , since the local authorities would not be able to complete\nmajor repair work at Spa-Francorchamps before the September race.[10] The Belgian Grand Prix returned in\n2007, when Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen took pole position and his third Belgian Grand Prix win in a row .\nIn 2008, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton survived a frantic last two laps in a late shower of rain to win the race.\nHamilton lost the lead to Ferrari's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen with an early spin but fough t back in the closing laps to\nre-take the lead with two laps to go. On a soaking track, Hamilton passed R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, lost the lead again with\na spin, re-took it and then saw R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n crash. Ferrari's Felipe Massa took second leaving him eight points\nbehind Hamilton. However , the stewards decided after the race to apply a 25-second penalty , considered a\ndrive-through penalty under the regulations, for Hamilton's pass on R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen  after they had deemed that\nHamilton had cut a corner in the Bus Stop chicane. This left Hamilton in third place behind Ferrari's Felipe\nMassa and BMW  Sauber's Nick Heidfeld. The penalty cut Hamilton's lead over Massa to just two points\nwith five races rema ining.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3993, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa1d25b0-63e8-454e-9cf5-edba65c69096": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa1d25b0-63e8-454e-9cf5-edba65c69096", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1290aa88-0af3-42b3-991f-680341c2463b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "5379e7052ebc009702215053c6bd5f9ecdfbe696afad915f4ad8957a8d6c0674", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64e37556-be45-4493-9cf0-f7dd78ab2b22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Belgian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "8a8a00c91ceaf9241db4dd40b9c7436a80b69913b307dc61166b7684f25e5503", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On a soaking track, Hamilton passed R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, lost the lead again with\na spin, re-took it and then saw R\u00e4ikk\u00f6ne n crash.
