It first appeared as a non-championship event\nin 1962 before being held as a championship event\nin 1963\u20131970 and 1986\u20131992. The Grand Prix\nreturned in 2015  at the Mexico City circuit, and\nheld the event from 2015 to 2019, and since 2021; it\nwas due to host the Grand Prix in 2020, but this was\ncancelled in respose to the COVID-19 pandem ic.\nThe venue is contracted to host the event until 2025.\nThe Mexican Grand Prix was first held on 4\nNovember 1962 at the Magdalena Mixhuca  circuit.\nThe circuit was the first international racetrack in\nMexico, and like Monza  in Milan , Italy, it was built\nwithin a park in the center part of a major city, in\nthis case the Mexican capital of Mexico City. The\nrace provided unique challenges for racing, standing\nat 2,240m  (7,340 ft) above sea level, as well as the\nlong, 180-degree, lightly banked and fast Peraltada\ncorner that finishes the lap, in addition to being a\nbumpy racetrack from actively shifting soils\nbeneath the circuit. The Mexican Grand Prix of this\nperiod was always the season finale Grand Prix,\nheld in late October .\nThe first race, a non-c hampionship affair which\nattracted a strong international entry , was won by\nTeam Lotus  with Jim Clark takin g over the car of teammate Trevor Taylor  to claim the win; Clark was\nblack-flagged after receiving a push-start at a confused race start. The meeting was marred by the death\nof young Mexican star Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez , killed in practice in a Rob Walker run Lotus 24 on the\nPeraltada.History\nMagdalena Mixhuca (1962\u20131970)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2397, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3494c50d-2676-4fd2-8e00-ace484399271": {"__data__": {"id_": "3494c50d-2676-4fd2-8e00-ace484399271", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c57bc90e-8b52-4726-9847-0cd853573ee8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "2defc77d0b856a06a4b0de8e419b988fdb6ceb287d8d6e5dbc8c02e7621edebc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Classic Mexican GP event logo.The Formula One World Championship arrived the following year with Clark winning again, equalling\nJuan Manuel Fangio 's record of most victories in a single season. 1964 saw the battle for both the Drivers'\nand Constructors' championships. British drivers Clark, John Surtees  and Graham Hill all arrived with a\nchance, with Hill leading the table, and Ferrari, BRM and Lotus were in contention for the Constructors'\nChampionship. Ferrari signalled Lorenzo Bandini  to let teammate Surtees through, which he did, and\nSurtees finished second behind Gurney  to win the cham pionship by one point; Ferrari won the\nConstructors' Championship.\nAmerican Richie Ginther  took victory for Honda in 1965, the Japanese company's first win in Formula\nOne. Clark  won his third Mexican Grand Prix in 1967, making him the most frequent winner of the race\nas of 2019.\nIn 1968, three men again came into the race with a chance of winning the Drivers' Championship: Hill,\nhis countr yman Jackie Stewart, and New Zealander and defending world champion Denny Hulme. The\nrace was a straight fight between Hill and Stewart; the Scotsman led for several laps until Hill passed\nhim. Hulm e was running third, but he had a rear suspension failure and crashed on Lap 11. Swiss Jo\nSiffert decided to get in on the mix and took the lead, but he had to pit with a broken throttle cable.\nStewart then fell back when his engine started to misfire, and he experience d handling and fuel-feed\nproblems. Hill had no problems and took victory and his second driver's championship.\nCrowd control in 1968 and 1970 contributed to cancellation of the event.[1] In 1970, a record crowd of\napproximately 200,000 arrived to see Pedro Rodr\u00edguez , forcing officials to delay the race start by an hour\nas they struggled to control the crowd.[2] At one point, a dog ran across the track and was hit by Stewart.\nDuring the race, spectators threw bottles on the track.[2] Amid the chaos, Clay Regazzoni  trailed Jacky\nIckx for a 1-2 Ferrari finish.[2]\nThe 1971 event was scheduled, with a large fund deposited in a Swiss bank  to help guarantee better\ncrowd control, but after the death of Pedro Rodriguez, the plan was abandoned.[2]\nThere had been a number of attempts to bring the Mexican Grand\nPrix back on the F1 calendar , one attempt being when it was\noriginally scheduled in April 1980, two weeks after the US Grand\nPrix West, but was cancelled. American IndyCars arrived for a brief\ntwo-year visit in 1980 and 1981, racing  as the Gran Premio Tecate\non the Magdalena Mixhuca track now named after Mexico's two\nlost racing heroes, Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez. The event was\ndominated by Rick Mear s. A number of years  later, work began on\nrebuilding the Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez circuit with much improved organisation. The circuit's layout was\nslightly shorter , the Peraltada's banking had been eased and the circuit was generally much safer than it\nhad been. The Grand Prix returned in 1986, where the race played host to Austrian Gerhard Berger's first\nwin in his Benetton B186 , in a race where an ill Berger outlasted his opposition, as tyre problems struck\nmost of the field. The circuit was still very rough and bumpy . 1987 saw the race being run in two parts. It\nwas stopped around mid-distance when Briton Derek Warwick  crashed heavily coming out of the\nPeraltada. Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet  finished first on the road, but because his Williams teammate\nNigel Mansell  was 30 seconds ahead when the first race ended, Mansell kept Piquet in sight and won the\nrace on cumulative time.Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez (1986\u20131992)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3626, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "787e7425-1c65-4481-9e53-6a0a9fcdbed8": {"__data__": {"id_": "787e7425-1c65-4481-9e53-6a0a9fcdbed8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e63f1a5-287f-42dc-a97d-49556e93d9cf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "3f44138906cd6ae5c324aa6695bbbd95c247e1a5f4b98c9950952f69459b8ca4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The 1988 race was moved from mid-October to a warmer and more rain-prone late May season slot, so\nthat it could be paired with the other North American Grands Prix in Montreal and Detroit. This race saw\nFrenchman Alain Prost dominate in his McLaren, and Prost's Brazilian teammate Ayrton Senna  won the\nnext year;  this was at a time when the two men's relationship was at a low point. 1990 saw the race\nmoved to late June. Prost, now at Ferrari, qualified 13th on the grid but drove through the field and took\nsecond from his teammate Mansell late in the race. Senna, who was leading, had a slow puncture that\nturned into shredded rubber , and he went into the pits to have it changed, but the suspension was too\nbadly damaged for the Brazilian to continue. This put Prost and Mansell 1\u20132, but Senna's teammate\nGerhard Berger was challenging Mansell for second; Berger passed the Englishman going into the\nMoises Solana  esses, but Mansell repassed him around the outside of the Peraltada on the same lap. Prost\nwon the race; Mansell and Berger finished second and third. 1991 saw Senna crash heavily at the\nPeraltada during practice; he was declared fit to race by FIA doctor Sid Watkins ; he finished third behind\nWilliams drivers Riccardo Patrese  and Mansell; but Senna had been critica l of the severely bumpy circuit\nall of that weekend.  On 9 October 1991, European media sources reported that promoters barely made\nenough funds to pay off F1 for the 1991 race. FISA  demanded improvements to the track for the 1992\nevent, which were made.[3]\nFor the 1992 season, the race had been moved further forward to March, and on 20 February of that year,\nMexico City's air pollution had reached  a record level. City officials had impo sed emer gency measures\nbanning half of government cars and equipment from the streets; this was not helped by the fact that\nMexico City is situated in a valley surrounded by mountains, which restricts polluted air to travel\nelsewhere to dissipate. This put extra stress on the Mexican Grand Prix committee to ensure the track was\nready for 1992.[4] Some safety measu res had been implem ented to the track, including further easing of\nthe banking at Peraltada, making the corner a little slower; this was done to avoid bypassing the entry to\nthis corner via making an alternate route to the middle of the Peraltada through the park's baseball\nstadium. Although the circuit was popular with drivers, they complained during interviews with the press\nabout the ubiquitous and severe bumps on the circuit, which had decayed even further and were worse\nthan before - even the Peraltada was very bumpy and Mansell nearly crashed there during practice.\nDespite these concerns, the race that year went ahead and saw Williams teamm ates Mansell and Patrese\ndominate the race. Senna had another bad accident during practice, this time at the fast Esses - Senna\nwent over a nasty series of bumps that unsettled the car to the point where Senna lost control, went off the\ntrack and hit a conc rete wall; he had minor injuries but qualified sixth and took part in the race. But the\nstate of the track, the decline of Mexico  City itself, not only with air pollution problems but also a rapid\nand unstable city population increase, saw Formula One leave again.\n2002 saw the reviva l of the Grand Prix of Mexico for Champ Cars on a much  modified version of the\nAut\u00f3dromo Herman os Rodr\u00edguez circuit, which included cutting the Peraltada in half. This was a six-year\nstay, which saw S\u00e9bastien Bourdais  win half of the six races that followed.\nRumors first surfaced in 2003 that the Mexican Grand Prix might return to the Formula One calendar at a\nnew $70 million  circuit, dubbed \"Mantarraya \", to be built near Canc\u00fan .[5] In 2005, the governor of\nQuintana Roo state said that Mexico would have a Grand Prix on the calendar for 2006 .[6] The plan was\nhalted later that year as a debate arose about whether the land the circuit was to be built on was properly\nowned by the right people to do so.[7]Absence (1993\u20132014)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4040, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f1b1977-12c8-4939-ae97-64b6f3bbf2ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f1b1977-12c8-4939-ae97-64b6f3bbf2ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c07f0d2-a8b2-4b17-b8ab-47660b56f1f3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Mexican_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "0daaeaa0b8b14676d2af0ce3d02030bdb9abc582c44a95ddec2a231823956a1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Seven-time World Champion Lewis\nHamilton clinched his fourth and fifth\ntitles in 2017 and 2018 respectively\nat the Mexican Grand Prix.After the 2006 United States Grand Prix, Bernie Ecclestone  announce d that the Grand Prix of Mexico\nwould return for the 2009  season, but nothing further came from the announcement.\nIn August 2011, Carlos Slim Domit  revealed plans for a revived\nrace.[8] In August 2013, it was suggested by \"high level sources\"\nthat the Mexican Grand Prix could be on the provisional 2014\nWorld Championship calendar .[9] A preliminary draft calendar for\nthe 2014 season, circulated in early September 2013, assigned 9\nNovember 2014 for the Mexican Grand Prix, but did not specify a\ncircuit and noted that the event was \"subject to confirmation\".[10]\nOn 5 December 2013, the FIA released the official 2014 Formula\nOne season calendar , and the Mexican Grand Prix was not on the\ncalendar; then the FIA announced that the Mexican Grand Prix\nwas postponed to 2015 due to lack of sufficient preparation time to\nupgrade the somew hat run-down Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez circuit to\nFormula 1 working standards.[11] In July 2014, Ecclestone confirmed that he had signed a 5-year deal for\nthe Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez track to host the Mexican Grand Prix, starting in 2015.[12] On 3 December\n2014, the FIA published a confirmed calendar for 2015[13] showing the 2015 Grand Prix of Mexic o on 1\nNovember 2015.
