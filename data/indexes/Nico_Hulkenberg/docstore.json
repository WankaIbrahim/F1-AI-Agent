H\u00fclkenber g, yet to score a podium in 158 races by the beginnin g of the 2019 season, said his \"future in\nthe sport depends on the outcome of the duel\" as his ability could be measured \"against a Grand Prix winner\", for the\nfirst time since his rookie season in 2010, when he was teammate to Rubens Barrichello  at Williams.

Then, on lap 53, 4 laps from\nthe end, disaster struck as both H\u00fclkenber g and Ricciardo, running 6th and 10th respectively , both retired with engine\nissues at the same corner.[64] Abiteboul  stated that Renault's engine problems were \"unacceptable\".[65] These issues were\ncompounded, when H\u00fclkenber g again retired from a points-scoring position with engine issues at the next race in China ,\nthis time with a software issue.[66] In Spain , H\u00fclkenber g crashed in qualifying and damaged his front wing.

H\u00fclkenber g recovered to 13th, but Leclerc eventually retired from the\nrace.[68] He then finished the next two races in 7th and 8th place in Canada  and France  respectively .
