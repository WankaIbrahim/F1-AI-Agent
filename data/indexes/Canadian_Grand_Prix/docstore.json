After 1971, safety concerns\nled to the Grand Prix moving permanently to\nMosport. In 1978, after similar safety concerns\nwith Mosp ort, the Canadian Grand Prix moved\nto its current home at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve\non Notre Dame Island  in Montreal , Quebec.\nIn 2005, the Canadian Grand Prix was the most\nwatched Formula One Grand Prix in the world.\nThe race was also the third most watched\nsporting event world wide, behind the first place\nSuper Bowl XXXIX  and that year\u2019s UEFA\nChampions League Final .[2]\nThe 2020 and 2021 events were cancel led due\nto the COVID-19 pandem ic.[3][4] After the\ncancellation of the 2021 Canadian Grand Prix,\nthe contract was extended to 2031.[5] The\nCanadian Grand Prix returned to the calendar in\nthe 2022  season.\nThe early Canadian Grand Prix was one of the\npremier events of the new Canadian Sports Car\nChampionship , a series which had been created alongside the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park near\nToronto  in 1961. Mosport Park (which is still in its original layout configuration) was a spectacular and\nchallenging circuit  which had many ups and downs; the circuit was popular with drivers.

In 1966 the Canadian-American Challenge Cup\nran the event, with American Mark Donohue  winn ing.[1] Formula One took over the following year,\nalthough the CSCC and Can-Am series continued to compete at Mosport in their own events.\nThe event  was run as part of the Formula One world championship first in 1967; Mosport Park was\nselected as the venue for the event. The Ontario circuit alternated with the Circuit Mont-T remblant  in\nQuebec, where the Canadian Grand Prix was held in 1968 and 1970. Mont-T remblant, located 11\u20442 hours\nnorthwest of Montreal, was much like Mosport Park in that it was a spectacular circuit which had\nsignificant elevation  change and was very challenging. The first championship race was held between the\nGerman and Italian rounds on 27 Augus t; it was won by Jack Brabh am with his New Zeala nder teammate\nDenny Hulme  completing a Brabham 1\u20132.\nThe 1968 event, which was moved to late September so it could be paired with the United States Grand\nPrix at Watkins Glen , saw the unlucky New Zealander Chris Amo n lead from  the start until 17 laps from\nthe end of the 90 lap distance when his gearbox broke; the McLaren team finished 1\u20132 with Amon's\ncountrymen Hulme and Bruce McLaren  taking top honours.\nFollowing the 1968 season, a group led by John Bassett  and race sponsor Imperial Tobacco  developed a\nproposal to move both the Grand Prix and Mosport's Telegram Trophy  IndyCar  race to a new street\ncircuit  in Toronto  along Lake Shore Boulevard  and through Exhibition Place  with the start/finish  line and\npits to be located inside Exhibition Stadium .[6][7][8] Bassett dropped the idea just as the bill was going\nthrough third reading before Toronto city council.[9] The idea to move the race to an urban location would\nreturn a decade later .\nThe 1969 event at Mosport Park saw Briton Jackie Stewart  climb up from 4th to take the lead, but Jacky\nIckx was comi ng up fast, and Stewart and Ickx battled until lap 33, when they came to lap privateer Al\nPease  for the fourth time,  Ickx attempted to pass Stewart, and the two cars collided. Stewart was unable\nto get his Matra going, but Ickx did get his Brabham going, and held onto the lead until the checkered\nflag. An angry Stewart complained to his boss Ken Tyrrell  abou t Pease, who complained to the\norganizers. The 48-year -old Pease was then given the black disqualification flag after completing less\nthan half the numb er of laps the leaders had completed in an almost embarr assingly outdated Eagle-\nClimax, and became the only driver in F1 history ever to be disqualified for being too slow. The 1970\nevent saw Ickx win again with his Swiss teammate Clay Regazzoni  making the result a Ferrari 1\u20132. But\nthe Mont-T remblant circuit was not used again for Formula One because of safety concerns regarding the\nbitter winters seriously affecting the track surface and a dispute with the local racing authorities there in\n1972. The alternating of the race stopped and Mosport solely continued to hold the Canadian Grand Prix\nfrom 1971.\nThe 1971 event saw Mosport Park flooded with rain and fog; the main event was delayed after a fatal\naccident at a Formula Ford support race and by the time it started, it was rainin g heavily . Jackie Stewart\ntook victory easily in a Tyrrell from Swede Ronnie Peterson  in a March. 1972 saw Mosport upgraded\nwith new safety features, and Stewart won again. 1973 was an interesting event; like the race 2 years\nprevious it was a rain-soaked event.

The crash occurred the lap\nafter he set the pole position lap for\nthe 1972 Canadian Grand Prix.in a Lotus  on Lap 3, Lauda led until the 20th lap when he came to\nchange tires; there was considerable confusion after Fran\u00e7ois\nCevert  and Jody Scheckter  collided on Lap 33 leading to a\nbungled pace car interlude after which things became very\nconfused as the pace car failed to pick up the leader and allowed\nthose ahead to gain almost a lap. All this meant that Briton Jackie\nOliver  ended up in the lead with American Peter Revson second\nand Frenchman Jean-Pierre Beltoise  third. Of these three Revson\nhad the most comp etitive car and so eventually moved into the\nlead and led all the way to the flag while Peterson's Brazilian\nteammate Emerson Fittipaldi  charged to try to make up for lost\nground and overtook Oliver and Belto ise in the closing laps to\ngrab second. For hours after the race confusion reigned but\neventually it was confirmed that Revson  was the winner - thanks to a lucky break when the pace car came\nout. The 1974 event  saw Fittipaldi win while his championship rivals Clay Regazzoni finished 2nd and\nJody Scheckter  crashed heavily after a brake failure on his Tyrrell. There was no 1975 even t, and the\n1976 event was one where Briton James Hunt  found out that his 9 points from Brands Hatch were taken\naway and he was disqualified; Hunt won the Canadian Grand Prix event that year, driving furiously\nthroughout the race.\n1977 was the race where French-Canadian Gilles Villeneuve  made his debut for Ferrari. But conce rns\nabout the bumpy Mosport Park's safety  arose when Briton Ian Ashley  had a horrendous accident while\ncresting a bumpy rise. Ashley's Hesketh flipped over the Armco guardrails and went into a television\ntower . The German-born Englishman was seriously injured and safety operations to rescue him were\ninefficient and time-consuming; and the lack of safety at Mosport was underlined when Jochen Mass lost\ncontrol of his McLaren and hit a guardrail that virtually flattened upon impact. Jody Scheckter  won this\nrace in his Wolf, but with continuing safety concerns, a new proposal was brought forward. Labatt , the\nsponsor who held the rights to F1 racing in Canada at the time, as well as the owners of Mosport Park\nrevived the 1968 proposal to move the race to Toronto's Exhibition Place after the FIA deemed Mosport\nas an unsuitable host facility going forward.[10] Toronto city council turned down the proposal by a\nmargin of two votes and within a few hours, Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau  had negotiated with Labatt to\nmove the race permanently to Montreal.[11][12][7] A third attempt at a Toronto race eventually came to\nfruition by competing Canadian brewer Molson  in 1986 as the Molson Indy Toronto , part of the Indy Car\nWorld Series[13][14]\nA plan was quickly put together to develop a track called the Circuit \u00cele Notre Dame  on a man-made\nisland in the middle of the St. Lawrence seaway that had been the site of the famous Expo '67; specific\nroads on the island were combined and modified, and then pit facilities were built to make a temporary\nrace track.

He had badly broken legs; it took the tall\nFrenchman months to recover . 1981 saw a rain-soaked event in which near end of the race, Villeneuve\ndemonstrated his car control skill when the front wing of his Ferrari was askew from a crash and he drove\non to third place with the car in this condition. Frenchman Jacques Laffite took what was to be his last F1\nvictory , followed by Briton John Watson  and Villeneuve.\nVilleneuve was killed in 1982 on his final qualifying lap for the\nBelgian Grand Prix.

Pironi and F1 doctor Sid\nWatkins  came to Paletti's aid to try to extract him from his car,\nwhich briefly caught fire. After a half-ho ur, the 23-year -old Paletti\nwas extrac ted and flown to a nearby hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Nelson Piquet won the\nrace in his Brabham. 1982 was also significant in that the race was moved from  October to June with the\nevent happening in early June ever since.\nIn 1983, Frenchman Ren\u00e9 Arnoux scored his first race win as a Ferrari driver , and the following year\nPiquet won again in a BMW -powered  Brabham. 1985 saw Ferrari finish 1\u20132 with Italian Michele\nAlboreto  and Swede Stefan Johansson  taking top honours from Frenchman Alain Prost , while Lotus\ngained their final ever lock-out of the front row when Elio de Angelis  and Ayrton Senna started 1\u20132. 1986\nwas a competitive race.

But Rosber g, like the other front runners, encountered problems,\nbenefiting Mansell who won the race.
