Davidson Hamilton  MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver  competing in\nFormula One, driving for Mercedes . He has won a joint-record seven Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles\n(tied with Michael Schumacher ), and holds the records for most wins  (105), pole positions  (104), and podium finishes\n(201), among others .\nBorn and raised in Stevenage , Hertfordshire , Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme  in 1998. This led\nto a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007  to 2012 , making him the first black  driver to race in the series. In his\ndebut season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner -up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen  by one point. The follow ing\nseason , he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\u2014making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the\nseason \u2014to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion . After six years with McLaren, Hamil ton\nsigned with Mercedes in 2013 .\nChanges to the regulations  for 2014  mandatin g the use of turbo-hybrid engine s saw the start of a highly successful\nperiod for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014  and 2015  during an\nintense rivalry  with teammate Nico Rosber g. Following Rosber g's retirement in 2016 , Ferrari 's Sebastian Vettel became\nHamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim\nconsecutive titles again in 2017  and 2018 . His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019  and 2020  to equal\nSchumacher's record  of seven drivers' titles. Hamilton surpassed 100 race wins and pole positions in 2021 . He will join\nFerrari  for the 2025  season.\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside\nthe sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion.\nHe has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in\nmotorsport.

During pre-\nseason testing in Bahrain , Mercede s introduced their \"zero sidep od\" car design, which was radically different to that of\nits competitors. Although the Mercedes W13 's innovative design elements provided promising results in the simulator , it\nsuffered with extreme porpoising  early in the season. To prevent this, the team was forced run their cars with higher ride\nheights compared to others, leading to significant loss of downforce, which limited the car's potential.[115] At the Saudi\nArabian Grand Prix, Hamilton deemed the car was \"undrivable\", after barely managing to finish in the points.[116]\nDuring the first half of the season, Hamilton was marginally low on points compared to Russell, despite his integral\ninvolvement in W13's development. He diligently experimented with various car setups during race weekends until the\nmajor car upgrades at the British Grand Prix. Once his focus and contribution shifted from development to the usual\nperformance, he was able achieve bette r results. Surpassing Russell's tally in the latter half of the season with more\npodium finishes and championship points.[117]\nDespite a difficult season Hamilton was able to set several driver records, includ ing most consecutive seasons with at least one podium finish, most consecutive\nseasons with at least one lap led, most races with a single constructor , most Q3 appearances, most top 10 finishes and chequered flags reached at the Monaco\nGrand Prix, most podium finishes at a single circuit, most points scored at the Monza Circuit  and most podium finishes at the United States Grand Prix.[118] By\nthe end of the season, Hamilton had scored nine podium finishes but failed to win a race nor a pole position in a season for the first time in his Formula One\ncareer .

Russell also signed a two-year extension, retaining Mercedes' driver pair.[126][127] Although Hamilton finished second at the United States Grand Prix,\nhe was stripped of the podium due to a post-race disqualification, caused by a technical infringement.

He just doesn't fade,\nmentally or physically .\"[150]\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in\nthose conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Ham ilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld  by over a minute, the\nlargest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[151][152] During the turbo-hy brid era, Hamilton\nremained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 Germ an\nGrand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen .[153] His wet weather drive at the 2020\nTurkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward  describing it as\n\"one of his greatest performances\".[102] Despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre\ntemperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop\nstrategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead\nand win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and\nfinished a lap down in 14th place.[154][155][156] Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.[157]\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him]\nwhen I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it\non the kart track.

both professionally and personally as he\ndid not finish highe r than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his\nstatus as the best driver in the sport.[192] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successf ul years with McLaren have also\nbeen cited  as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive\nseasons

Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David\nCoulthard  declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\",[82] an opinion\nwhich was widely accepted among the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers.[85] As Hamilton became more\nwidely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern

leave McLaren for Mercedes.[174] Herbert compared Hamilton to tennis player Roger Federer  and golfer Tiger Woods .[205]\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons.\nIn later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[206]\nHamilton continued  to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career , but in 2014 decided to\nchange to a mostly white approach.[207] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[208] The winning\ndesign used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of\nHamilton's three Formula One champion ships at that time, on either side.[209] Over  the following seasons, Hamilton continued to\nadd more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles.[210]\nHamilton has worn

At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, he sporte d an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel imag e on the\ntop.[211] At the 2015 Mala ysian Grand Prix, Hamilton  brought with him a striking  blue-and-green design in honour of team\nsponsor Petronas but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[212] Ham ilton has sport ed gold coloured helmets three\ntimes in his career . After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars\nadorning the top of the helmet with the words World Champion .[213] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand\nPrix after sealing his fifth world title, towards which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[210] and did\nso again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix , this time with six stars following his sixth World Championship title.[214]\nHamilton has also used one-of f helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career . At the 2011 Braz ilian Grand\nPrix, he wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna\nFoundation .[215] At the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay\ntribute to Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back.\nAfter the race, Hamilton reflected on Lauda's career , saying: \"Ultimately , as a driver , my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely\nsomeone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many .\"[216] Ham ilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton\nSenna at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix .[217]\nHamilton switched into a different desig n in 2020, which used black as base colour with purple details, in support of Black Lives Matter , he also continued to\nuse the same design  in 2021.[218] Hamilton  wore a rainbow helmet at the 2021 Qata r Grand Prix, 2021 Saud i Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand\nPrix in suppor t of the LGBTQ+ community .[219] Ahea d of the 2022 season, Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, it\nalso used purple details.[220] He also used one-of f designs for the 2022 Mon aco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand\nPrix.[221][222][223] Evolutions of the yellow helmet design were used in 2023 and 2024.[224] He wore special designs for the 2023 Japanese Grand Prix and 2023\nS\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix .", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4106, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0509fafd-ce0e-407b-8a0e-f0fc21a1e4b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0509fafd-ce0e-407b-8a0e-f0fc21a1e4b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Lewis_Hamilton.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7a553d0-6f7c-49b1-a580-7c32b0d2376c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Lewis_Hamilton.pdf"}, "hash": "16dc0c777e91304fc4d148ec04c720ead5fc7648672b710a1b7b26d0552fcdb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "224d6e1e-c23b-4606-807a-d8e2de704f23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Lewis_Hamilton.pdf"}, "hash": "e14bef40358122b613991792939b2b21ef3d5ca2bf167668af3985f94e34a0db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[218] Hamilton  wore a rainbow helmet at the 2021 Qata r Grand Prix, 2021 Saud i Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand\nPrix in suppor t of the LGBTQ+ community .[219] Ahea d of the 2022 season, Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, it\nalso used purple details.[220] He also used one-of f designs for the 2022 Mon aco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand\nPrix.[221][222][223] Evolutions of the yellow helmet design were used in 2023 and 2024.[224] He wore special designs for the 2023 Japanese Grand Prix and 2023\nS\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix .[225][226]\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso . In their time as\nteammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result  of several incidents. The first tensions\nsurfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco  in 2007.[227] After post-race comments made by\nHamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken\nrules by enforcing team orders.[228] McL aren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team,\nstating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all\nother cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"[228]\nTensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out\non track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on\na race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then\nin place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary .[18] Hamilton  was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of\nthe session .[229] Alonso was relegat ed to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was\ndocked Constructor s' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[230]\nHamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[231] British motorsport journal Autosport  claimed that this \"[led]\nDennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\";[232] however , McLaren\nlater issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity .[233]\nAs a resul t of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamil ton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a\nshort period.[234][235] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo  regarding a Ferrari  drive for 2008 .[236] The\nrivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[237][238][239] Alonso and McLaren\nterminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[240] In subsequent years , tensions between the\npair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[241] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a\ngood car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\"[191] Alonso later describ ed Hamilton as one of the top five\ngreatest drivers of all time.[63] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying\ntribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[242]Helmet\nRivalries\nFernando Alonso", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3496, "end_char_idx": 7416, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23a3e56d-8a90-4e5f-bdb5-7b761e42555b": {"__data__": {"id_": "23a3e56d-8a90-4e5f-bdb5-7b761e42555b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Lewis_Hamilton.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b562fcfc-aeae-4566-981d-3bff04c89a33", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Lewis_Hamilton.pdf"}, "hash": "f7128a378a8c5664d32e87b59eb37050fd43100d6ad85bf85594c11f26abcdf2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f7d1fc7-d616-47c5-8a0b-af6cb35da062", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "255cbceaa3389d73349a6393bdaa850c67705b893882e1489c1f1a19a5770044", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hamilton (left) and Rosberg (right)\nat the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix\nHamilton (left) and Vettel (right) at\nthe 2017 United States Grand Prix\nHamilton was racially abused by\nfans during 2010 pre-season testing\nat Jerez.In their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season.

At the end of their season as\nteammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having\nmore second-place finishes.[243]\nWhen Ham ilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosb erg. Over\ntheir four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became\nstrained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[244] Ham ilton and Rosber g were first teammates\nin 2000, when they were in karting.[245] They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became\nEuropean champion, with Rosber g not far behind. Robert Kubica , who raced with them before Formula One, recalled\nhow they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating\ntwo at a time.\"[246] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings;[246] Rosber g, an only child, was born in\nGermany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Form ula One world champion, Keke Rosb erg,\nwhereas Hamilton was born on a council estate  in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's\njunior racing.[20]\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton  compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability but\nwith an intellect to match Rosber g's.[162] Buxton wrote:\nMan to man against Rosber g, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher . He has made his\ntires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think  Germany , think Hungary) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he\nhasn't used too much  fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent\nchancer many paint Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot.[162]\nTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosber g, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\",\nwas alway s more analytical.[20] This led some to believe that Rosber g would achieve greater success in Formu la One, the highest level of open-wheel racing,\ndue to the intellectu al capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management, and moderate fuel usage.[162] Hamilton 's tyre management has\nfrequently allowed him to push on for longer , often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the\ngrid.
