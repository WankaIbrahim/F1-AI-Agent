Typical of\nEuropean motorsports at the time, this race\nwas done as a test to convince the FIA if the\nInterlagos circuit and its organizers could\ncapably hold a Grand Prix. Like most major\ncircuits used for Grands Prix in Latin America\nsuch as the Herman os Rodr\u00edguez Autodrome\nin Mexico City, Interlagos was (and still is)\nlocated in the confines of a sprawling urban\nneighborhood in a very large city. The\nfollowing year, however , the race was first\nincluded in the official calendar , and it was\nwon by defending world champion and S\u00e3o\nPaulo native Emerson Fittipaldi . In 1974,\nFittipaldi won again in rain soaked conditions,\nand the year after, another S\u00e3o Paulo native, Carlos Pace , won the race in his Brabham, followed by\nFittipaldi. 1977 was won by Reutemann, but the drivers began complaining about Interlagos's very rough\nsurface, and the event was then relocated for a year to the new Jacarepagu\u00e1 circuit in Rio de Janeiro.\nAfter a year in Rio, the race returned to Interlagos, with new and upgraded facilities for the next two\nseasons; this race was won by Jacques Laffite to comple te his and Ligier's conquest of the opening South\nAmerican rounds in Argentina  and Brazil. But the Interlagos surface was still very bumpy . The original\narrangement from 1978 onwards was to alternate the Brazilian Grand Prix between the S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio\ncircuits; the 1980 race was originally supposed to be held at Jacarepagu\u00e1 but parts of that circuit (which\nwas origin ally built on a swamp) were beginning to sink into the soft ground and the circuit disintegrated\nbadly , so the 1980 Grand Prix was to be relocated to Interlagos. But by this time, the population of S\u00e3o\nPaulo had risen from 5 to 8 million over the space of 10 years; the area surrounding the track was\nbecoming increasingly run-down and the circuit did not look good for Formula One, which thanks to\nworldwide television exposure was becoming something of a glamorous spectacle. Formula One was\noriginally supposed to come back to Interlagos for the 1981 season after the track surface there had been\nrepaved; it turned out that F1 came back a year too early . The drivers were dissatisfied with the safety\nconditions of the very bumpy 7.873 km (4.892 mi) Interlagos circuit which had not been changed after\nthe previous year's improvements. The ground-ef fect wing cars of that year had a tendency to bounce up\nand down thanks to the suction created by the cars' wing-shaped underbodies, and they were more stiffly\nsuspended than before; so these fragile  cars were barely tolerant of such a rough track and were very\nunpleasant to drive. The bad surface was so rough that the bumps caused mechanical problems for some\ncars. Also, the barriers and catch-fence arrangements were not adequate enough for Formula One.

With Formula One's more glamorous image being better suited to the\nbetter -looking city of Rio de Janeiro, the F1 circus went back to Rio again and the circuit went on to host\nthe 1980s turbo era.\nIn 1978  the Brazi lian Grand  Prix moved to Jacarepagu\u00e1  in Rio de Janeiro. Argentine Carlos Reutemann\ndominated in his Ferrari, which was equipped with superior Michelin tyres. This proved to be the French\ncompany's first victory in Formula One. Reutemann was followed by home favorite Fittipaldi and\ndefending champion Niki Lauda .[1]\nAfter the emer gence in 1980 of Rio de Janeiro racer Nelson Piquet , the decli ne of Interlagos and the\nretirement of Fittipaldi, Brazilian fans lobbied to host the Brazilian GP in Piquet's home town. The flat\nJacarepagu\u00e1 circuit, like Interlagos before it, proved to be extremely demanding: most corners were long\nand fast, some were  slightly banked and the track had a very abrasive surface.  Due to the FIA calendar ,\nwhich invariably had the Brazilian GP at the beginning of the season thus in the Southern hemisphere\nsummer and the tropical weather of Rio, most races were held under very high temperatures and high\nhumidity . Due to all of those circumstances, Grands Prix at Rio were highly demanding and most drivers\nwho won it were exhausted in the end.\nIn 1981, Carlos Reutemann  disobeyed team orders to let his teammate Alan Jones  by and took the\nvictory; the following year Piquet finished first and Keke Rosberg finished second but because of the\nFISA\u2013FOCA  war, Piquet and Rosb erg were both disqualified for being underweight in post-race\nscrutineering, and the race victory was given to third placed Alain Prost , who would go on to win at\nJacarepagu\u00e1 four more times (thus earning the nickname \"the King of Rio\"). The race also saw Italian\nRiccardo Patrese  retire due to physical exhaustion (a very rare occurrence in F1, but quite common at\nRio). Piquet won in 1983 and 1986, and the 1988 race was particularly notable, as up-and-coming star\nAyrton Senna started from the pit-lane in his first race for McLaren; he began a furious charge that\nbrought him up to second behind his teammate Prost; but he was disqualified for switching to his spare\ncar after the parade lap had begun. The 1989  event was the last race at Jacarepagu\u00e1. It was won by British\ndriver Nigel Mansell in his Ferrari, in the first Grand Prix won by a car with a semi-automatic gearbox,\nand it also saw German Bernd Schneider  and American Eddie Cheever  collide, and Cheev er collapsed\ntwice after he exited his car due to exhaustion.\nS\u00e3o Paulo native Ayrton Senna's success thus far in Formula One had city officials working hard to\nrevamp the Interlagos circuit in a $15 million investment to shorten and smooth  over the circuit. In 1990\nthe Grand Prix returned to a shortened Interlagos, where it has stayed since. The Interlagos circuit has\ncreated some of the most exciting and memorable races in recent F1 history , and is regarded as one of the\nmost challenging and exciting circuits on the F1 calendar .\nThe first race at the new Interlagos in 1990 was won by Alain Prost , who won his 40th career race (the\nmost ever at that point in time) and his sixth Brazilian Grand Prix. It wasn't a popular win, as the events\nof the previous year's Japanese Grand Prix were still fresh in the minds of many Brazilians: Prost was\nseen as having been given the Drivers' title by FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre  at Senna's expense after\nSenna was disqualified from that race in Japan. The Brazilian, a home favorite, finished third in Brazil\nafter leading much of the race but then hitting his backmarker ex-teammate Satoru Nakajima in a Tyrrell.Jacarepagu\u00e1, Rio de Janeiro\nReturn to a new Interlagos", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3760, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10682e16-e58d-4508-a084-c5e0c14f6beb": {"__data__": {"id_": "10682e16-e58d-4508-a084-c5e0c14f6beb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Brazilian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "912f2938-fdda-46ec-bddd-973142f820ab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Brazilian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "16551f91efb89561be7e75b96efc94a42713b2b09c2e0359f1bfe7d050c7c63d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Audience of the 2004 Brazilian\nGrand Prix1991 saw the patrio tic Senna emotionally win his first Brazilian Grand Prix. His McLaren's manual\ngearbox was losing gears quickly and close to the end, he only had sixth gear left. This made the car\nmuch more difficult and physically demanding to drive, but he still eventually won holding off Williams\ndriver Riccardo Patrese. His exhaustion was so high that had to be extricated from his car. 1992 saw\nMansell dominate the weekend and the rest of the season. 1993 was a race of variables; it began to rain\nheavily early into the race and Prost, now driving a Williams, had a rare accident on the main straight and\nretired. Senna went on to win in a McL aren from Prost's teammate Damon Hill. 1994 saw Senna, now\ndriving for Williams, spin his recalcitrant car going through Juncao late into the race. He was running in\nsecond, trying to catch German Michael Schumacher , who went on to win. Senna would lose his life in an\naccident at the San Marino Grand Prix later in the year. 1995 was a very contr oversial race that initially\nhad race winner Schumacher and Briton  David Coulthard's cars excluded for apparently using illegal fuel\nduring the race, but then reinstated. 1996 saw Damon Hill win his first of eight races that season. 1997\nsaw an accident at the start that involved four cars, and Canadian Jacques Villeneuve  went  off the course\nat the first corner; the race was stopped and restarted, and Villeneuve jumped into the spare car and won\nthe race. 1998 saw a controversy surrounding McLaren \u2013 Ferrari had protested about their braking\nsystem, and it was then banned from the Brazilian Grand Prix, although it had been approved four times\nby FIA technical delegate Charlie Whitin g. It didn't matter much: Finnish McLaren driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen\nwon the race anywa y. 1999 saw local Rubens Barrichello  lead for some time until the engine in his car\nfailed, and Hakkinen won again.\nThe 2001 Grand Prix was notable for marking the explosive\narrival of Juan Pablo  Montoya  onto the Formula One scene. The\nColombian driver stunningly muscled his way past Michael\nSchumacher early on and led easily until an incident in which\nArrows's Jos Verstappen  ran into the back of his Williams-BMW\nand ended his race. Montoya did eventually laid to rest the ghost\nof this event by winning the 2004 race in his final Grand Prix for\nWilliams before moving to McLaren, holding off his future\nteammate Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen  to take a hard-fough t victory . The 2001\nrace is also notable for two brothers, Michael and Ralf\nSchumacher , sharing a row on the starting grid for the first time.\nParticularly memora ble recent Brazilian Grands Prix include the 2003 race, which saw a maiden Grand\nPrix victory , highly unexpectedly , and amidst chaotic and unusual circumstanc es, for Jordan 's Giancarlo\nFisichella . Heavy rain before and during the race produced problems with tyre selection which caught out\nmany team s, which allowed the weak Minardi  team to have a real chance for victory the only time ever,\nbecause they were the only team who prepared for the rainfall, but their drivers were also soon out. And\ntreacherous track conditions caused multiple drivers to spin out of the race, including then-reigning World\nChampion Michael Schumacher , endin g a remarkable run of race finishes dating back to the 2001\nGerman Grand Prix. Amidst this, a number of drivers, inclu ding McLaren's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and David\nCoulthard , led the race, and, when a heavy accident involving Renault's Fernando Alon so blocked the\ncircuit and brought out the red flag, confusion reigned. Fisichella led the race at the time, having just\novertaken R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen; however , it was the Finn who was declared the race winner under the rule that\nstipulated that the race result in such circumstances was to be taken from the running order two laps prior\nto the race being stopped. This decision was overturned days later in the FIA Court of Appeal in Paris\nafter new evidence came to light which proved that Fisichella had crossed the finish line in the lead for a", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4079, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1c25e13-a84f-4b35-bdcb-04018eb7a271": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1c25e13-a84f-4b35-bdcb-04018eb7a271", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Brazilian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4a078d76-a191-4953-bebc-f9891a2039cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Brazilian_Grand_Prix.pdf"}, "hash": "30aa2fc9931dce619ca3ba166bc00b16259be6471e61a4651feac2637926b2a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, the\nvenue for the Brazilian Grand Prix\nSafety car at the 2006 Brazilian Grand\nPrixsecond time befor e Alonso's accident, and therefore was the rightful winner .

Starting from 10th\nposition on the grid, Schumacher did an astonishing job on his\nlast race. He fell to 19th position on the ninth lap due to a flat\ntyre caused by a minor collision with Giancarlo Fisichella\nwhen the former was trying to overtake the latter .

His performance was not\nenough to give Schumacher his eighth trophy , as Fernando\nAlonso, who needed only one point to become World\nChampion again, finished in second place. Brazilian Felipe Massa took pole position  and led the race\nfrom start to finish to get the second victory of his career and to be greeted by celebrations from his\nBrazilian supporters.\nIn the 2007 edition, Kimi Raikkonen  won the race and his first and only championship, beating both\nFernando Alonso  and Lewis Hamilton  by a single point.\nIn March 2008, the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo  announced that he had signed a new deal with Bernie Ecclestone\nto continue the holding of the Brazilian  Grand Prix. This deal allowed the Brazilian race to be on the\ncalendar until 2015. With this, Interlagos was set for major improvements in its pit and paddock\nfacilities.[2]\nIn the final race of the 2008 season in Brazil, Lewis Hamilton became the youngest Formula One World\nChampion up to that point in Formula One history . After adopting a conservative strategy without risks\nfor most of the race to secure at least fifth place, and the title, a late-race rain shower caused unexpected\ntrouble. First, Hamilton was pushed down to fifth place by German Toyota driver Timo Glock  who didn't\nenter the pits for intermediates like most other front runners. With just three laps to go, Sebastian Vettel\nthen also overtook the Briton on the track which meant he would end up with equal points to Massa, but\nwith one fewer victory . While everybody was focusing on the battle between these two (Vettel managed\nto stay in front in the end), against all expectations both were able to overtake Glock, who had lost all\ngrip with his dry-weather tyres, in the very last corner before the finishing straight.
